Additionally, project scoping activities that PDM funds also contribute to other sub-objectives.

It does so with a recognition of the growing hazards associated with climate change , and of the need for natural hazard risk mitigation activities that promote climate adaptation and resilience with respect to those hazards. These include both acute extreme weather events and chronic stressors which have been observed and are expected to increase in intensity and frequency in the future. The BRIC program\u2019s guiding principles include supporting communities through capability and capacity-building; encouraging and enabling innovation, including multi-hazard resilience or nature-based solutions; promoting partnerships; enabling large, systems-based projects; maintaining flexibility; and providing consistency. Through these efforts communities are able to better understand disaster risk and vulnerabilities, conduct community-driven resilience, hazard mitigation planning, and design transformational projects and programs. \n\n\n\nAwards made under this funding opportunity will be funded, in whole or in part, with funds appropriated by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, also more commonly known as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL).

The SRL program differs from FEMA's other mitigation grant programs in that those property owners who decline offers of mitigation assistance will be subject to increases to their insurance premium rates. An SRL property is a residential property that is covered under an NFIP flood insurance policy and: (a) That has at least four NFIP claim payments (including building and contents) over $, each, and the cumulative amount of such claims payments exceeds $,; or (b) For which at least two separate claims payments (building payments only) have been made with the cumulative amount of the building portion of such claims exceeding the market value of the building. For both (a) and (b) above, at least two of the referenced claims must have occurred within any -year period, and must be greater than  days apart. Only the following mitigation activities are eligible for the SRL program:\n\nAcquisitions\/Relocations: The acquisition of the structure and underlying real property for the purpose of creating open space, demolition or relocation of the structure, and conversion of the property to deed-restricted open space uses in perpetuity;\nElevations: Any activity through which an existing building with the lowest floor below the base flood elevation (BFE) is physically raised to an elevation at or above the BFE;\nMitigation Reconstruction: Any activity where an existing building and\/or foundation is partially or completely demolished or destroyed and an improved, elevated building is constructed on the same site;\nMinor Localized Flood Reduction Projects; and\nFloodproofing.\nCertain project activities and their associated costs are not eligible, which are outlined in this program's guidance.

RFC funds may only mitigate structures that are located within a state or community that cannot meet the cost share or management capacity requirements of the Flood Mitigation Assistance (FMA) program. RFC awards will prioritize projects that create the greatest savings to the National Flood Insurance Fund (NFIF) based on a benefit-cost ratio (BCR). The BCR must be calculated using a FEMA-approved methodology.
