The study will analyze improvements for the portion of I-95 that bifurcates the East End Neighborhood and isolates it from Downton Bridgeport, Bridgeport Harbor, and Steel pointe. The study area is a racially diverse neighborhood and has experienced disproportionate economic, social, and environmental burdens due to the current location of the I-95 Exit 29 Interchange, as well as rail and water pollution control infrastructure. The study will review concepts for the entrance and exit ramps, including alternatives to remove or reduce the physical barriers in certain locations to ensure the network provides safe, reliable mobility options and access to economic opportunities. The study will evaluate current and future uses and provide a forum for robust public engagement to better align the transportation infrastructure with the goals and needs of the East End and the City of Bridgeport focusing on pedestrian and bicycle improvements. Interstate-95 cuts the East End neighborhood from access to transit including the citys bus hub, Metro North, and Amtrak rail station. Following its construction, the Connecticut Department of Transportation (CTDOT) converted CT-130, Stratford and Connecticut Avenues, into one-way couplets through the East End that further reduced pedestrian, bicyclist, and transit user safety. This project will fund planning to enable the ultimate construction of a pedestrian connection, linking together the Borough of Naugatucks Metro North Rail Line and downtown core in the west with the Naugatuck River Greenway Trail and State Route Highway 8 in the east. The BRIDGE study will be conducted in collaboration with the City of Bridgeport and CTDOT. Several community stakeholders, including Groundwork Bridgeport and the East End Neighborhood Revitalization Zone (NRZ) will play an active role in leading the plan for reconnecting the neighborhood to the vital facilities around it.","38285":"Swinomish Village Sidewalk Gaps: Swinomish Village Sidewalk Gaps","13782":"Presidio91.5: Local Multijurisdictional Multihazard Mitigation Plan - UPDATE","487":"Graham600.1: Warning Systems (as a Component of a Planned, Adopted, and Exercised Risk Reduction Plan)","2911":"Wichita200.1: Acquisition of Private Real Property (Structures and Land) - Riverine","13616":"Catron91.1: Local Multihazard Mitigation Plan","14160":"Sanilac403.4: Stormwater Management - Detention\/Retention Basins","18619":"Hidalgo403.1: Stormwater Management - Culverts","16856":"Walker206.2: Safe Room (Tornado and Severe Wind Shelter) - Public Structures","29893":"Andrew600.1: Warning Systems (as a Component of a Planned, Adopted, and Exercised Risk Reduction Plan)","35041":"Improve\/Modify\/Rehabilitate Terminal Building: Improve\/Modify\/Rehabilitate Terminal Building","21797":"Tulsa601.1: Generators","20578":"Otoe601.2: Generators - Regular","1402":"Calvert200.1: Acquisition of Private Real Property (Structures and Land) - Riverine","26044":"","33928":"Savannah\/Hilton Head International Airport: Construct or Improve Fuel Farm","27155":"Miami-Dade205.8: Retrofitting Public Structures - Wind","21929":"Cook600.1: Warning Systems (as a Component of a Planned, Adopted, and Exercised Risk Reduction Plan)","19819":"Washington700.1: Management Costs - Salaries","19580":"Washington91.3: Local Multihazard Mitigation Plan - UPDATE","28695":"Potter206.1: Safe Room (Tornado and Severe Wind Shelter) - Private Structures","2403":"Orangeburg600.1: Warning Systems (as a Component of a Planned, Adopted, and Exercised Risk Reduction Plan)","1828":"Washington200.1: Acquisition of Private Real Property (Structures and Land) - Riverine","23379":"Contra Costa205.6: Structural Retrofitting\/Rehabilitating Public Structures - Seismic","7164":"","28414":"Lafayette202.1: Elevation of Private Structures - Riverine","5616":"","3575":"Volusia200.1: Acquisition of Private Real Property (Structures and Land) - Riverine","38308":"Randall Road Grade Separation and Intersection Safety Improvements Project: The project is strong in Safety and State of Good Repair.

The U.S. Highway 101 runs north-south through the center of the city, dividing the west and east sides of the Greenfield community with a four-lane highway. The existing bridges that cross over U.S. 101 at Walnut Avenue and Oak Avenue are inadequate to accommodate the anticipated population growth and are already creating a choke point or barrier for residents traveling between the west and east sides of the city. With only two travel lanes, the bridges currently have a service level rating of \u201cD\u201d which will continue to worsen. Additionally, the overcrossings are not wide enough to accommodate bike lanes and the sidewalks are substandard. Walnut Avenue is the busiest corridor in Greenfield for pedestrians, bicyclists, and automobiles. Additionally, Apple Avenue does not currently have a crossing over U.S. 101 but it has been identified as an ideal location for a multi-use pedestrian and bicycle bridge because it would connect the low-income housing on the east side of the city to vital daily destinations west of U.S. 101.Proposed developments along Apple Avenue will address multimodal connectivity deficiencies and, with the new overcrossing, create an active transportation corridor. This project will help the City of Greenfield complete the necessary planning work to address transportation system deficiencies and improve active transportation infrastructure. These improvements are necessary to facilitate efficient connectivity between west and east Greenfield, which are divided by U.S. Highway 101.","23045":"Erie601.1: Generators; \n602.1: Other Equipment Purchase and Installation","31699":"Beckham601.1: Generators","19423":"Payne600.1: Warning Systems (as a Component of a Planned, Adopted, and Exercised Risk Reduction Plan)","21399":"Wyoming200.1: Acquisition of Private Real Property (Structures and Land) - Riverine","18125":"Sebastian206.2: Safe Room (Tornado and Severe Wind Shelter) - Public Structures","24855":"Statewide91.1: Local Multihazard Mitigation Plan","23152":"Brown91.1: Local Multihazard Mitigation Plan","25430":"Warren402.1: Infrastructure Protective Measures (Roads and Bridges)","5124":"","13856":"San Patricio91.3: Local Multihazard Mitigation Plan - UPDATE","6981":"Tangipahoa403.1: Stormwater Management - Culverts","9758":"Lyon300.3: Vegetation Management - Wind","9583":"Sanders91.5: Local Multijurisdictional Multihazard Mitigation Plan - UPDATE","20548":"Sharp206.2: Safe Room (Tornado and Severe Wind Shelter) - Public Structures","35369":"Transforming the Providence I-95 Northbound Viaduct: The Rhode Island Department of Transportation will be awarded $60.355 million to rebuild the Providence Interstate 95 Northbound Viaduct.","8518":"Schoharie200.1: Acquisition of Private Real Property (Structures and Land) - Riverine","26918":"King91.1: Local Multihazard Mitigation Plan","15725":"Runnels601.2: Generators - Regular","29387":"Sampson200.1: Acquisition of Private Real Property (Structures and Land) - Riverine","7986":"Las Piedras205.8: Retrofitting Public Structures - Wind","18233":"Statewide700.1: Management Costs - Salaries; \n700.2: Management Costs - Equipment; \n700.4: Management Costs - Supplies","17701":"Oldham200.1: Acquisition of Private Real Property (Structures and Land) - Riverine; \n202.1: Elevation of Private Structures - Riverine","21871":"Jefferson602.1: Other Equipment Purchase and Installation","27412":"St. Thomas206.2: Safe Room (Tornado and Severe Wind Shelter) - Public Structures","33273":"Fremont403.1: Stormwater Management - Culverts","24525":"Statewide600.1: Warning Systems (as a Component of a Planned, Adopted, and Exercised Risk Reduction Plan)","21066":"Mobile601.1: Generators","23234":"Aiken401.1: Water and Sanitary Sewer System Protective Measures","17039":"Wright400.1: Utility Protective Measures (Electric, Gas, etc.)","29711":"Spencer402.1: Infrastructure Protective Measures (Roads and Bridges)","4023":"Kennebec403.1: Stormwater Management - Culverts","9310":"Fleming200.1: Acquisition of Private Real Property (Structures and Land) - Riverine","15594":"Statewide206.1: Safe Room (Tornado and Severe Wind Shelter) - Private Structures","32703":"Adjuntas205.8: Retrofitting Public Structures - Wind","10916":"Jackson91.5: Local Multijurisdictional Multihazard Mitigation Plan - UPDATE","11141":"","35354":"I-10 Congestion Relief - Mobile River Bridge and Bayway: The Alabama Department of Transportation will be awarded $125 million to construct a new six-lane cable-stayed bridge with more than 215 feet of vertical clearance to carry I-10 across the Mobile River channel.","36924":"42nd Street Grade Separation Project to Improve Efficiency, Connectivity, Equity, and Safety (PIECES): The proposed project will support final design and construction of a grade separation and add a 10-foot shared-use path.

The NAE funding will support community engagement, neighborhood planning, environmental assessment, design, and construction of 15 miles of the Emerald Trail, a 34-mile, off-street bicycle and pedestrian trail and linear park system to reconnect Jacksonvilles urban core communities. Once completed, the Emerald Trail will increase neighborhood equity, safety, and affordable transportation access in Jacksonville. To this day, I-95 and I-10 divide Black communities in central Jacksonville and force residents to depend on expensive and polluting car transportation for basic needs or risk their safety on car_x0002_oriented roadways with no pedestrian access to reach critical services, grocery stores, jobs, and educational opportunities. The result: Jacksonville is consistently on the top-10 list of U.S. cities with the highest rates of pedestrian and bicycle fatalities. Although 27.9% of households within the census tracts served by the Project do not have access to a vehicle, there are currently limited facilities for pedestrians and cyclists to cross I-95, including those who use JTAs extensive transit network to reach essential services and jobs. The Emerald Trail Master Plan, funded and developed by GWJax, was formally adopted by the city Council in 2019. The Emerald Trail is envisioned as a community project, and neighborhoods are key partners in the work. Neighborhood residents have been at the decision-making table from the very beginning as members of the Steering Committee that developed the Emerald Trail Master Plan, and residents are members on every trail and creek project committee. The city took the lead in designing and constructing the initial phases of the trail in collaboration with GWJax. Significant progress has been made over the past 4 years, with 40% of the Emerald Trail Project being in design, under construction, or completed. In total, GWJax has secured $21 million in funding, and the city has committed $208 million. In addition, the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) constructed the Shared Use Path across the I-95 Fuller Warren Bridge, part of Emerald Trail Segment 11, for $20 million.","34017":"Neil Armstrong Airport: Seal Runway Pavement Surface\/Pavement Joints","1307":"Josephine600.1: Warning Systems (as a Component of a Planned, Adopted, and Exercised Risk Reduction Plan)","28526":"Lee403.1: Stormwater Management - Culverts","12629":"Monroe600.1: Warning Systems (as a Component of a Planned, Adopted, and Exercised Risk Reduction Plan)","31140":"Statewide92.1: State Multihazard Mitigation Plan","35975":"Klawock Cooperative Association Transportation Safety Update Update the transportation safety plan using current data analysis techniques and counterm_AK: Klawock Cooperative Association Transportation Safety Update: Update the transportation safety plan using current data, analysis techniques, and countermeasure approaches.","13929":"Lebanon103.1: Feasibility, Engineering and Design Studies; \n106.2: Other Non Construction","15358":"Orleans405.1: Other Minor Flood Control","6808":"Wilson91.1: Local Multihazard Mitigation Plan","30482":"","13655":"Atlantic403.3: Stormwater Management - Flapgates\/Floodgates","5221":"Lincoln91.5: Local Multijurisdictional Multihazard Mitigation Plan - UPDATE","7988":"Ascension202.1: Elevation of Private Structures - Riverine","9713":"","7772":"Washington403.1: Stormwater Management - Culverts","7771":"Washington103.1: Feasibility, Engineering and Design Studies; \n405.1: Other Minor Flood Control","30226":"St. Mary403.1: Stormwater Management - Culverts","18179":"Woodford601.1: Generators","31865":"Philadelphia700.1: Management Costs - Salaries","5749":"Wayne91.1: Local Multihazard Mitigation Plan","6752":"Duval103.1: Feasibility, Engineering and Design Studies; \n403.1: Stormwater Management - Culverts","8521":"Luzerne200.1: Acquisition of Private Real Property (Structures and Land) - Riverine","24661":"Garvin91.1: Local Multihazard Mitigation Plan","8821":"Columbus200.1: Acquisition of Private Real Property (Structures and Land) - Riverine","16250":"Statewide202.2: Elevation of Private Structures - Coastal","19558":"Calhoun90.4: Mitigation Plan - Local Multihazard Mitigation Plan","29383":"San Joaquin403.1: Stormwater Management - Culverts","29737":"Harris202.2: Elevation of Private Structures - Coastal","24925":"Statewide92.1: State Multihazard Mitigation Plan","17256":"Atlantic402.1: Infrastructure Protective Measures (Roads and Bridges)","28428":"Fayette200.1: Acquisition of Private Real Property (Structures and Land) - Riverine","30208":"","7936":"Sabana Grande205.8: Retrofitting Public Structures - Wind","32279":"St. Charles800.1: Miscellaneous","10641":"Cochise91.1: Local Multihazard Mitigation Plan","3092":"DeSoto205.8: Retrofitting Public Structures - Wind","12994":"Lewis202.1: Elevation of Private Structures - Riverine","1989":"Fairfax200.1: Acquisition of Private Real Property (Structures and Land) - Riverine","34640":"Reconstruct Runway Lighting: Reconstruct Runway Lighting","37841":"Sonoma County Transportation Authority Planning and Demonstration Activities: This award will be used by Sonoma County Transportation Authority to: 1) conduct a Countywide speed limit review and reduction analysis, and City of Healdsburg Engineering and Traffic Survey, 2) develop a Countywide Safe Routes to School Plan, and update the City of Healdsburg's Safe Routes to School Plan, 3) make updates to the County's Vision Zero data dashboard and progress reporting, and 4) conduct a City of Petaluma - Lakeville corridor multi-modal improvements study.","1342":"El Dorado91.3: Local Multihazard Mitigation Plan - UPDATE","13256":"Trego91.1: Local Multihazard Mitigation Plan","28563":"Miami-Dade403.1: Stormwater Management - Culverts","33062":"Tama400.1: Utility Protective Measures (Electric, Gas, etc.)","4447":"Montgomery600.1: Warning Systems (as a Component of a Planned, Adopted, and Exercised Risk Reduction Plan)","37139":"Colorado Department of Transportation on behalf of ECO Transit_CO_Buses and Bus Facilities Competitive Program: The Colorado Department of Transportation, on behalf of Eagle County Regional Transportation Authority (ECO Transit), will receive funding to renovate its vehicle storage facility, removing its gas-based heating source and implementing a geothermal heating system.

Bluefield, an historic African American community, is hampered by crumbling bridge infrastructure and an active rail yard that quite literally divides the community. The active rail line sees over 19 trains travel thorough the 300\u2019 wide Norfolk Southern railyard daily, with the gentrified commercial center on one side, and Bluefield\u2019s historic \u201cEast End\u201d African American community on the other (a literal \u201cwrong side of the tracks,\u201d as the application notes). Everyone in Bluefield is impacted by the rail lines, but the residents of the East End fared the worst, as the most recent census placed the population at less than half (9,658) of its peak in 1950 (21,500). As planned, the corridor would traverse the East End side of the railroad yard and from the East End to downtown Bluefield via Cherry Street, creating a modern multi-modal street facility that would integrate with centrally located bridge landings on that side, and provide updated sidewalks, bike lanes, landscaping and streetscaping.

The project addresses transportation inequities by providing safe walking, bicycling, and rolling facilities that do not exist today and by improving crossings of dividing facilities like Highway 20 and the railroad. The project provides accessible active transportation infrastructure along with streetscape improvements that provide resilient infrastructure. This will spur new economic development and community wealth to build a thriving Old Town community. Old Town Decatur was once a thriving African American community, with mixed-use development and various family-owned businesses. Urban renewal and decades of disinvestment devastated the community. Today, half the neighborhood is vacant, and the community sees high rates of poverty. 92% of the project corridor is located within disadvantaged communities, and the area is in the 90th percentile for projected flood risk and expected population loss. The communities have high rates of asthma, diabetes, heart disease, and other health issues. Old Town does not have access to grocery stores; residents must cross Highway 20 to reach these amenities. The trail will provide connections to parks and commercial redevelopment along the Tennessee River, as well as schools, jobs, community services, and places of worship. The project will improve safe access to important resources, including separate walking and biking facilities and safer intersections.

Over 50 years ago, the State of Alaska converted local community streets to high-speed arterials, referred to as a highway couplet, connecting the New Seward A-3 and Glenn A-1 Highways through the Fairview neighborhood. This direct bifurcation resulted in a two block wide \u201cno-man\u2019s land\u201d between the two streets, turning the middle Hyder Street into a 10-block long community wasteland. The Alaska Department of Transportation and Public Facilities is currently one year into a Planning and Environmental Linkages study and exploring potential alternative options for the corridor. This project will study options to narrow the corridor and reduce community barriers, land use for housing, and the conversion of parking lots into community gardens. The application emphasizes the importance of the adequate consideration of public input in planning for revitalization efforts in the East Downtown and Fairview neighborhoods. The Gambell\/Ingra corridor is a high-speed road that spans 10 blocks, runs through the Fairview neighborhood, and presents many safety challenges. Safety for all road users and increased mobility for non-motorized transportation is a priority for this plan. The application includes a memorandum of agreement signed between the Fairview Community Council and NeighborWorks. Each of these organizations will serve defined roles stated in the agreement. The team is already working together on another project funded by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The project will enable Fairview neighborhood to build on that work. Additionally, public engagement strategies will be designed to educate the community and generate interest in participating in design workshops and charettes.","5556":"Itasca400.1: Utility Protective Measures (Electric, Gas, etc.)","24030":"Solano403.4: Stormwater Management - Detention\/Retention Basins","19074":"Hillsborough601.2: Generators - Regular","5708":"Shenandoah200.1: Acquisition of Private Real Property (Structures and Land) - Riverine","28253":"","30245":"Harris601.1: Generators","32233":"Madison91.1: Local Multihazard Mitigation Plan","15651":"Wise200.1: Acquisition of Private Real Property (Structures and Land) - Riverine","24172":"Pearl River200.1: Acquisition of Private Real Property (Structures and Land) - Riverine","17829":"Baltimore (city)601.2: Generators - Regular","33465":"Tippah601.1: Generators","5158":"Statewide700.1: Management Costs - Salaries","37634":"Healing Hollywood: The Healing Hollywood project proposes a cap park over US 101. US 101 is an open-air below grade eight lane limited access freeway that transformed the landscape by replacing the small middle-class homes, duplexes, and bungalow courts with a concrete trench separating low_x0002_income and middle-class families. Not only did this facility destroy homes and construct a barrier separating the community, but it also introduced excessive levels of automobile traffic bringing with it noise, air pollution, water pollution, hydrology changes, and social and economic upheaval. Friends of the Hollywood Central Park (FHCP) propose to heal the wounds from the Hollywood Freeway and mitigate ongoing burdens by designing and building a cap park over the below grade facility. The Hollywood Central Park (HCP) will rest on an engineered platform that reduces noise, filters vehicle emissions, and captures stormwater while creating a beautiful and accessible green space with amenities selected by the community. The project will build 37.6 acres of park in one of the most park-poor areas of California, bringing the opportunity for safe outdoor play. The project also proposes five miles of universally accessible paths for pedestrians, bicyclists, and for service\/emergency vehicles. These paths are designed to flow north\/south and east\/west providing links to the neighborhood circulation networks as well as to established public transit. The paths are anticipated to often serve as a last mile\/first mile linkage to both light rail and bus routes.","980":"Rutland90.4: Mitigation Plan - Local Multihazard Mitigation Plan","18386":"Santa Rosa403.2: Stormwater Management - Diversions; \n405.1: Other Minor Flood Control","32992":"Nueces91.4: Local Multijurisdictional Multihazard Mitigation Plan - NEW ","18757":"Clinton400.1: Utility Protective Measures (Electric, Gas, etc.)","30106":"Winston206.2: Safe Room (Tornado and Severe Wind Shelter) - Public Structures","12166":"Sussex202.2: Elevation of Private Structures - Coastal","14579":"Monmouth401.1: Water and Sanitary Sewer System Protective Measures; \n601.1: Generators; \n602.1: Other Equipment Purchase and Installation","19505":"Adams200.1: Acquisition of Private Real Property (Structures and Land) - Riverine","1965":"Gage200.1: Acquisition of Private Real Property (Structures and Land) - Riverine","15022":"Dane206.2: Safe Room (Tornado and Severe Wind Shelter) - Public Structures","15325":"Defiance206.2: Safe Room (Tornado and Severe Wind Shelter) - Public Structures","20340":"Greenville400.1: Utility Protective Measures (Electric, Gas, etc.)","24520":"Jefferson300.2: Vegetation Management - Wildfire; \n700.1: Management Costs - Salaries","28034":"","36311":"Reduce Extended Delays; Enhance Safety; and Invest in Growing Neighborhoods (R.E.D.E.S.I.G.N.)

The proposed extension of Perry Street over the Beltline will allow vehicles, buses, pedestrians, and cyclists to access the businesses located south of the highway. The project will benefit the Burr Oaks and Brams Addition neighborhoods, which have been identified as \u201cdisadvantaged\u201d by the White House Council on Environmental Qualitys Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool (CEJST). RCN investment will allow area residents to safely cross a \u201cdividing facility\u201d and advance equity, connectivity, and workforce development opportunities in South Madison. Today, fencing and the Beltline Highway cut Perry Street in half. While the roadway picks up on the other side, residents living north of the highway say its hard to get to the employment opportunities in commercial and industrial areas awaiting them on the other side. The Perry Street Overpass will eliminate the need for circuitous and dangerous north-south routes around the Beltline Highway. In order to get from Madison College-Goodman South Campus on the north side of the Beltline to a business hiring apprentices on the south side of the highway, it is currently a 1.9-mile trip which takes 6 minutes by car, 10 minutes by bicycle, or 37 minutes as a pedestrian, over which half the time is spent walking on streets without sidewalks.

The planning effort will include public and stakeholder engagement, an existing conditions evaluation, design and analysis (three alternatives to extend past Hillcroft Avenue project north and two alternatives to extend it south), and a recommendation and implementation plan. I-69 and Westpark Tollway are major barriers located to the north and west sides of Gulfton as well as multiple thoroughfares to the south. The project would be a continuation of the Hillcroft Avenue Safety Project, which established connections between a few crucial destinations. This project would evaluate new and existing crossings needed to provide safe and improved access for all users, especially for the disadvantaged populations who are disproportionately impacted by the facilities. Several feasibility studies have been completed that identified the need for better connections and laid the groundwork for this project. With over 50 languages spoken and some of the lowest car ownership in the city, Gulfton is Houston\u2019s most dense, diverse, and transit-dependent neighborhood. It is also home to some of the City\u2019s widest, fastest and least hospitable roadways \u2013 multilane thoroughfares like Hillcroft Avenue and imposing freeways like Interstate 69 and the Westpark Tollway. Legacy infrastructure to the north and south have proven difficult obstacles, limiting the reach of the City\u2019s investment and Gulfton\u2019s access to schools, parks, commercial centers, and transit hubs. The project relies on several formal partnerships, and it addresses the use of community centered decision making and approaches to facilitate authentic engagement.

The project will be led by the Office of Planning & Community Development (OPCD) and a Community Advisory Board, and will promote equity and inclusion, build capacity, and work to address past harms caused by the freeway. The I-5 freeway divides people from essential services, creates an environmentally toxic landscape, and disrupts over half the street grid. The proposed lid would provide acres of land for affordable housing, reconnect communities divided for generations, offer restorative open spaces, and increase environmentally-friendly transportation options to access the regions employment, social service, and cultural centers. Parks and open space on the lid will fill a desperate need for more open space in a city center with among the nations lowest amount per capita. Just 6% of center city land is allocated to parks and public open space (compared to 12% citywide). This project builds on the OPCDs 2020 Lid Feasibility Study. The volunteer Lid I-5 community group formed in 2015 and has since met with thousands of community members, WSDOT leadership, and local, state, and federal elected and appointed officials. Lid I-5 has been the projects lead advocate and has worked closely with OPCD on this grant application and many other endeavors related to lidding I-5. Their coalition includes dozens of other community groups representing equity, parks, affordable housing and commercial space, transportation choices, and the environment. Lid I-5s leading partners are the Downtown Seattle Association (DSA) and the Seattle Parks Foundation. This project seeks to mend the social and urban fabric of Seattle by providing acres of land for affordable housing, reconnecting communities divided for generations, offering restorative open spaces, increasing environmentally friendly transportation options, and re-introducing the mix of buildings, streets, and landscapes that were demolished for the freeway.","17811":"Hancock402.1: Infrastructure Protective Measures (Roads and Bridges)","4920":"Charlevoix403.1: Stormwater Management - Culverts","28933":"Gogebic401.1: Water and Sanitary Sewer System Protective Measures","22529":"Statewide90.4: Mitigation Plan - Local Multihazard Mitigation Plan","32230":"Utah403.4: Stormwater Management - Detention\/Retention Basins","22228":"Horry800.1: Miscellaneous","13628":"Jefferson206.1: Safe Room (Tornado and Severe Wind Shelter) - Private Structures","13691":"DuPage200.1: Acquisition of Private Real Property (Structures and Land) - Riverine","9026":"Mayes200.1: Acquisition of Private Real Property (Structures and Land) - Riverine","31830":"","10669":"Statewide92.2: State Multihazard Mitigation Plan - UPDATE","13998":"Montgomery91.1: Local Multihazard Mitigation Plan","33681":"Benton601.1: Generators","28464":"Vernon91.1: Local Multihazard Mitigation Plan","36668":"Long Bridge Bicycle and Pedestrian Crossing Project: The project will create a new approximately 2,300-foot-long bicycle-pedestrian bridge that crosses the Potomac River between Long Bridge Park in Arlington, VA and East and West Potomac Parks in Washington, DC.","24888":"Statewide700.1: Management Costs - Salaries; \n700.2: Management Costs - Equipment; \n700.4: Management Costs - Supplies","34349":"Construct Terminal Building: Construct Terminal Building","3677":"Knox202.1: Elevation of Private Structures - Riverine","3798":"Clay200.3: Acquisition of Public Real Property (Structures and Land) - Riverine; \n200.5: Acquisition of Vacant Land","2195":"Skagit200.1: Acquisition of Private Real Property (Structures and Land) - Riverine","16962":"Statewide93.1: Tribal (Local) Multihazard Mitigation Plan","32351":"Culebra205.8: Retrofitting Public Structures - Wind","17509":"Hancock91.3: Local Multihazard Mitigation Plan - UPDATE","8774":"DeKalb200.1: Acquisition of Private Real Property (Structures and Land) - Riverine","18419":"Richland91.1: Local Multihazard Mitigation Plan","19870":"Schuyler402.1: Infrastructure Protective Measures (Roads and Bridges); \n403.1: Stormwater Management - Culverts; \n403.2: Stormwater Management - Diversions","9530":"Kanawha200.1: Acquisition of Private Real Property (Structures and Land) - Riverine","21508":"Martin103.1: Feasibility, Engineering and Design Studies; \n403.1: Stormwater Management - Culverts; \n403.2: Stormwater Management - Diversions","1417":"Acadia206.2: Safe Room (Tornado and Severe Wind Shelter) - Public Structures","37741":"Connecting Pearl Highlands to Opportunity Project: The Connecting Pearl Highlands to Opportunity Project will construct a pedestrian bridge that will connect a historically disadvantaged community with the newly opened Pearl Highlands Waiawa Station on the Honolulu Rail Transit (HRT) system.

The area flourished until the 1950s, when Jackson Ward was completely bisected by I-95\/64. This catalyzed decades of economic and social decline that persist to this day. The application was built off data, community focused outreach, and recommendations from existing feasibility studies, with the most relevant being the Reconnect Jackson Ward Feasibility Study. The application places emphasis on addressing poor mobility, access, and safety, while focusing on anti-displacement and inclusive economic development efforts.

The roadway project cut through the heart of an economically disadvantaged community with five lanes of pavement and high-speed vehicular traffic. The roadway created a barrier that separated neighbors on both sides of the arterial. Residents on one side of the arterial are isolated from neighbors, a park, and an elementary school on the other side of the roadway. Many residents, whose only means of transportation is by foot or bicycle, have had to navigate narrow sidewalks with few opportunities to safely cross this treacherous stretch of roadway. Stakeholders from within the Metropolitan Planning Organization deliberated on ways to enhance safety and mobility for vulnerable users along the unsafe corridor, which led to recommendations embraced by all parties. Those recommendations include a roundabout at one key intersection and modifying the roadway corridor into a Complete Street by eliminating left turning traffic, providing a continuous refuge median for safer pedestrian crossings, and implementing roadside features, like wider sidewalks and street trees that give visual cues to motorists to drive slower, which accommodates bicycle and pedestrian mobility in the corridor.","11886":"Statewide700.1: Management Costs - Salaries;

These barriers exist along the citys planned three-mile San Antonio Creek Multi-Use Trail. The trail will run north to south through the entire length of the city, connecting to the 20-mile regional east-west Pacific Electric (PE) Trail at its northern terminus near the Montclair Transcenter (Transcenter). Currently, pedestrians and bicyclists cannot traverse across the Metrolink Rail line. Separately, the existing pathway under the I-10 Freeway barrier is blighted and lacks adequate clearance for pedestrians and bicyclists to safely navigate and connect to the future San Antonio Creek Trail. Without safe over\/under crossings at both locations, pedestrians and bicyclists must travel along busy city streets to mitigate these barriers. The completion of the planning and design needed for pedestrian crossings at the two barriers is a critical step to providing a safer, fully continuous multi-use trail spanning the length of the city. Increased access and connectivity will support greater use of active transportation throughout the city, thus reducing harmful greenhouse gas emissions in neighborhoods already burdened with high levels of air pollution, alleviate local traffic congestion, and mitigate environmental impacts. Additionally, the trail will reconnect residents with public transportation options at the Transcenter, such as the Metrolink Rail, Los Angeles and San Bernardino bus transit services, and the future Gold-Line Extension - the only light-rail project connecting Los Angeles, Pasadena, and the San Gabriel Valley with the Inland Empire.","31709":"Lenawee91.3: Local Multihazard Mitigation Plan - UPDATE","9822":"Kern403.1: Stormwater Management - Culverts","32400":"Hampden601.1: Generators","24392":"Wood91.1: Local Multihazard Mitigation Plan","19622":"St. Tammany202.2: Elevation of Private Structures - Coastal","4538":"","13922":"Lincoln402.1: Infrastructure Protective Measures (Roads and Bridges)","27045":"Roanoke200.1: Acquisition of Private Real Property (Structures and Land) - Riverine","28423":"Mills91.1: Local Multihazard Mitigation Plan","35903":"Honoapiilani Highway Realignment Project: This project will relocate an approximately 4.5 mile section of the existing two-lane undivided Honoapiilani Highway (Milepost 12.5 to Milepost 17) to a new alignment further inland on the west coast of Maui.

Shoreline Drive was historically part of California\u2019s interstate freeway network (as I-710), a post-World War II \u201curban renewal\u201d project, which demolished the working-class Magnolia and West Beach neighborhoods, removing homes and businesses and replacing them with the existing divided road that operates at highway speeds. Shoreline Drive is a major barrier to community assets and is a safety hazard for those seeking to reach community park space, Downtown Long Beach, and other nearby destinations. Northbound Shoreline Drive blocks off a grass median, and requires people to cross the threelane, 50 MPH roadway with no crosswalks. By consolidating north and southbound lanes to the west, the accessible portion of Cesar Chavez Park will be expanded by approximately 5.5 acres, double its current size, as well as move traffic and the associated pollution further away from Edison and Cesar Chavez Elementary Schools. The project will also create good-paying jobs and help ensure construction companies hire underrepresented workers. Specifically, the project will use a project labor agreement and local hiring preferences.

Currently, there exist multiple barriers to safe and effective transportation between the Walnut Tree neighborhood (primarily racial minority) and schools, goods and services located in downtown Walnut Cove. There is precisely one roadway that provides access to the rest of town from the Walnut Tree neighborhood and points south and east. That roadway, NC Highway 65 has a speed limit of 45 mph within town, no sidewalks, and almost non-existent shoulders. The Walnut Tree Neighborhood is approximately 3,000 linear feet from downtown Walnut Cove. However, a resident would have to walk approximately 1.2 miles to access downtown via the existing roadway.

These roadways have been identified on Fayetteville\u2019s high-injury network (HIN), which represents just 12% of Fayetteville\u2019s roadway miles but accounts for 60% of killed and serious injury (KSI) crashes. This project will implement five major capital improvement projects on high-injury corridors, paired with a community-wide education and awareness campaign (funded as a supplemental planning and demonstration activity). The five major projects will implement Proven Safety Countermeasures including improved lighting and corridor access management; appropriate speed limits; roundabout installation; dedicated left- and right-turn lanes at intersections; and vulnerable road user countermeasures including raised medians, pedestrian refuge islands, road diets, sidewalks, bike lanes, rectangular rapid-flashing beacons, and crosswalk visibility enhancements.","15655":"Covington600.1: Warning Systems (as a Component of a Planned, Adopted, and Exercised Risk Reduction Plan)","1638":"Broward205.8: Retrofitting Public Structures - Wind","14500":"Cattaraugus403.2: Stormwater Management - Diversions","16729":"Imperial95.1: FMA or CRS Plan","1499":"Dorchester100.1: Public Awareness and Education (Brochures, Workshops, Videos, etc.)","22454":"Horry205.8: Retrofitting Public Structures - Wind","4197":"Statewide700.1: Management Costs - Salaries","29892":"Travis200.1: Acquisition of Private Real Property (Structures and Land) - Riverine","3175":"Cass405.1: Other Minor Flood Control","27872":"Charleston401.1: Water and Sanitary Sewer System Protective Measures","36762":"Philip Billard Municipal Airport_KS_Airport Terminal Program: The existing general aviation terminal building, originally constructed in the 1950s, has exceeded its useful life.

The unincorporated community of East Missoula is less than 3 miles from downtown Missoula, a regional hub of commerce, education, medical services, and more. Yet, because East Missoula sits in a canyon, surrounded by impassable terrain and federal lands, the only viable routes in and out of the proposed project area are Interstate-90 (I-90) and the corridor of focus, Highway 200. This corridor is an outdated rural highway with a history of severe and fatal crashes that lacks safe, comfortable, and convenient multimodal facilities. Hwy 200 acts as a barrier to meaningful growth in and around East Missoula, exacerbates income inequalities, inhibits community building, and creates safety hazards for all road users. Historically, East Missoula was its own community, with local services and a vibrant economy based around the timber industry, facilitated by proximity to the Clark Fork and Blackfoot Rivers, major railroad routes, and nearby mills. For much of the twentieth century, extractive industry provided high-paying jobs to thousands of employees in the region at any given time, and East Missoula, being located between Missoula and a large mill complex, was at the heart of this economy. When the timber industry started to decline in the 1990s, so did East Missoulas economy. Absent its major industry and functionally cut off from the rest of Missoula, East Missoula has been economically transitioning and working to rebuild their community since the industry decline. This Reconnecting East Missoula construction project builds upon previous planning efforts. In addition to being a key element of the Hwy 200 Corridor Plan, the transformation of Highway 200 is the central focus of East Missoulas Community Vision.","38316":"Elko Nevada Rail Corridor Enhancement Project: The project will design and construct improvements on the Union Pacific Railroad (UP) Overland Route at the UP Elko Yard.

The new tunnel will reconnect several east-west roads that were severed and enhance east-west connections with safe crossing options. The Humboldt Parkway would be reconstructed with Complete Streets design features. Construction of the highway in the 1960s required the demolition of more than 600 residential properties, the removal of a landscaped median and created a barrier to community connectivity. The construction of the expressway resulted in substantial residential displacement with the primarily Black population within Buffalo confined to the East Side, isolated with low access to jobs, grocery stores, and banks. The project is intended to attract new businesses, create equity, and add value to the community. In addition, the project will invest in green spaces and parkland to improve the community quality of life. Community engagement has been made possible through various community groups and elected officials. The application includes information about an advisory committee consisting of various community groups to address the community needs\/concerns. The City of Buffalo has also completed a comprehensive plan to provide a framework to advance developments in the corridor consistent with the goals of the proposed project. The State DOT will require that disadvantaged business enterprises policies are followed. In addition, the project will help cultural institutions for building revitalization, and cultural projects on East Side neighborhood buildings.","9186":"Statewide700.1: Management Costs - Salaries","6189":"New Hanover90.4: Mitigation Plan - Local Multihazard Mitigation Plan","28367":"Harris400.1: Utility Protective Measures (Electric, Gas, etc.)","24467":"Lincoln400.1: Utility Protective Measures (Electric, Gas, etc.)","4858":"Black Hawk206.2: Safe Room (Tornado and Severe Wind Shelter) - Public Structures","12687":"Pierce91.1: Local Multihazard Mitigation Plan","27942":"Caguas91.1: Local Multihazard Mitigation Plan","92":"Jefferson205.8: Retrofitting Public Structures - Wind","23383":"Contra Costa205.6: Structural Retrofitting\/Rehabilitating Public Structures - Seismic","20073":"St. James205.8A: RETRO - Retrofitting Public Structures - Wind","7955":"Roane200.1: Acquisition of Private Real Property (Structures and Land) - Riverine","15341":"Statewide700.1: Management Costs - Salaries; \n700.4: Management Costs - Supplies","9003":"Barnstable403.1: Stormwater Management - Culverts","8212":"Bristol601.2: Generators - Regular","17886":"Cumberland602.1: Other Equipment Purchase and Installation","33539":"","38288":"Update the Transportation Safety Plan: Update the Transportation Safety Plan","7095":"Grenada200.1: Acquisition of Private Real Property (Structures and Land) - Riverine","4630":"Berkeley200.1: Acquisition of Private Real Property (Structures and Land) - Riverine; \n200.5: Acquisition of Vacant Land","17552":"Clayton401.1: Water and Sanitary Sewer System Protective Measures; \n403.4: Stormwater Management - Detention\/Retention Basins","34210":"Install Runway Vertical: Install Runway Vertical\/Visual Guidance System","22024":"Statewide700.1: Management Costs - Salaries","36760":"Augusta Municipal Airport_KS_Airport Terminal Program: This project removes and installs a new HVAC system in the General Aviation terminal building.

A road diet study is currently underway, to be completed at the end of 2023. This application is for NAE funds to complete preliminary engineering and a final design for a road diet, traffic calming, and the East Coast Greenway project along State Route 291. Currently, residents must contend with many barriers that have cut off their community and made it unsafe to try to get from one side of the city to the other. These include several rail lines, I-95, and Pennsylvania State Route 291. Route 291, also known as Second Street or \u201ca highway through a community\u201d, as some residents call it, traverses Chester, a majority Black or African American city in Delaware County, southeastern Pennsylvania. Nearly 40% of households within a block of Route 291 in Chester do not have a vehicle and 45% of those families are living below the poverty line. When asked about their vision for the area, many citizens wish to be able to cross Route 291 to access the recreational facilities and amenities along the Riverfront. These include the sports complex mentioned previously, the Riverwalk, Harrahs Casino and Barry Bridge Park. However, the current design of the roadway leads to multiple hazards for pedestrians, bicyclists, and motorists alike. The road is lined with limited, narrow sidewalks, poor and missing road signage, and few controlled pedestrian crossings and traffic signals.","23575":"Garvin91.1: Local Multihazard Mitigation Plan","8226":"Lawrence91.1: Local Multihazard Mitigation Plan","3184":"Volusia103.1: Feasibility, Engineering and Design Studies; \n403.1: Stormwater Management - Culverts; \n403.4: Stormwater Management - Detention\/Retention Basins","15800":"Powell91.1: Local Multihazard Mitigation Plan","38143":"Cle Elum Safety Action Plan Development with Supplemental ADA Self Evaluation and Program Access Plan: This award will be used by the City of Cle Elum to develop a comprehensive safety action plan and an ADA Self Evaluation and Program Access Plan, which will include a comprehensive inventory and condition assessment of the City's transportation facilities and rights of way providing access to public facilities.","9334":"Los Angeles205.4: Non Structural Retrofitting\/Rehabilitating Public Structures - Seismic","29003":"Claiborne600.1: Warning Systems (as a Component of a Planned, Adopted, and Exercised Risk Reduction Plan)","10085":"Allamakee600.1: Warning Systems (as a Component of a Planned, Adopted, and Exercised Risk Reduction Plan)","11348":"Kanawha200.1: Acquisition of Private Real Property (Structures and Land) - Riverine","25041":"Fairfield601.1: Generators","455":"Jefferson403.4: Stormwater Management - Detention\/Retention Basins","19042":"York601.2: Generators - Regular","3474":"Broward601.2: Generators - Regular","3704":"Broward601.2: Generators - Regular","13563":"Statewide700.1: Management Costs - Salaries","19113":"","26070":"Sheridan402.1: Infrastructure Protective Measures (Roads and Bridges)","33713":"Travis91.1: Local Multihazard Mitigation Plan","17118":"Coffee206.1: Safe Room (Tornado and Severe Wind Shelter) - Private Structures","35172":"Broward County Transit to rehabilitate its existing operations and maintenance buildings construct new administrationoperations and training buildings_FL: Broward County Transit will receive funding to rehabilitate its existing operations and maintenance buildings, construct new administration\/operations and training buildings and add infrastructure for electric buses.

Projet Benefits: The project is strong in safety, environmental sustainability, quality of life, mobility and community connectivity, economic competitiveness and opportunity, state of good repair, and partnership and collaboration. Safety will be addressed through the redesign of the station which will reduce conflict points between pedestrians and buses by separating rider boarding areas from the pathways bus use to enter and exit the facility. Environmental sustainability will be addressed through the inclusion of electric bus charging infrastructure which will facilitate a transition to using zero emissions buses. The project will provide quality of life improvements for riders who will now have indoor waiting spaces and basic amenities while waiting for buses.

The project will develop a plan to connect across the open-cut highway by building an open space for the community and prepare design guidelines to link the surrounding streets and facilities. Construction of I-90 displaced hundreds of Chinese American families through land seizure and demolition, including removal of the thriving Hudson Street neighborhood, for the installation of a ramp and retaining wall. In the Leather District, another thriving and historically Chinese American community, roughly 20% of Chinese American family homes were impacted by the construction. As a result, Boston\u2019s Chinatown now lacks access to safe and open greenspace, affordable housing, and is disproportionately impacted by traffic, and unclean air. This project is intended to directly address the longstanding physical division in Boston\u2019s historic Chinatown and to repair and enrich the area located between Shawmut Avenue and Washington Street, a disadvantaged community that has been marginalized, underserved, and overburdened by pollution. This project would also increase greenery and safe and accessible walking routes, improve safety and decrease the use of motorized vehicles. The City of Boston proposes to create a steering committee of city and community members in the planning process. The application suggests that the air rights created by the connection could be used to create housing and job opportunities for the neighborhood.","15530":"San Patricio401.1: Water and Sanitary Sewer System Protective Measures","23919":"Statewide202.1: Elevation of Private Structures - Riverine","12273":"Baldwin601.1: Generators","21944":"Statewide601.2: Generators - Regular","16306":"Adams200.1: Acquisition of Private Real Property (Structures and Land) - Riverine","3165":"Ventura91.1: Local Multihazard Mitigation Plan","18544":"Dauphin202.1: Elevation of Private Structures - Riverine","14648":"Bienville403.1: Stormwater Management - Culverts","8287":"Palm Beach205.8: Retrofitting Public Structures - Wind","21765":"New Haven202.2: Elevation of Private Structures - Coastal","9135":"Caribou205.6: Structural Retrofitting\/Rehabilitating Public Structures - Seismic","4873":"Amador403.2: Stormwater Management - Diversions","30377":"","5367":"Duval205.8: Retrofitting Public Structures - Wind","10747":"Bryan91.1: Local Multihazard Mitigation Plan","23042":"Cook601.1: Generators","35778":"The City of Knoxvilles Knoxville Area Transit to purchase zeroemission battery electric buses and charging equipment_TN: The City of Knoxville's Knoxville Area Transit will receive funds to purchase zero-emission battery electric buses and charging equipment.

This may take the form of a series of multi-modal bridges or a novel solution that transforms the entire urban landscape, such as a tunnel, train box, greenway deck, or a combination. Salt Lake City is currently divided by a regional north-south transportation corridor that has divided eastwest connectivity. The planning project is the result of prior studies, including Rio Grande Plan, SLC Ped\/Bike Plan, and SLC Climate Positive 2040. Beginning in 1870 with transcontinental railroad construction, the Westside neighborhood in Salt Lake City has always been more racially, ethnically, and socio-economically diverse than the city as a whole. While the rail lines were a cause for celebration, they were used to redline and divide the city in the 1940s, with homesteads and farms constructed west of the rails less desirable and often used as a dumping ground for waste. This legacy of limited access to opportunities and socio-economic disparity has led to current conditions, with over a quarter of the Westside\u2019s largely Hispanic population having a poverty rate of 26% with highly limited English proficiency. The application describes how the existing railroad harms and divides the community, proving a significant barrier to schools, jobs, grocery stores, and other destinations. The planning effort prioritizes the elimination of barriers and is likely to improve access to daily destinations, while demonstrating a strong intention to address equitable mitigation of impacts. The project will utilize a Community Advisory Committee, which will create a community participation plan that will create equity in participation by providing a stipend. The project seeks to enhance active modes that reduce greenhouse gas emissions with the consideration for safe accommodation. The project provides substantial detail about partnerships with commitment letters. The city is creating a housing trust and, if new land is opened up, affordable housing would be a part of future redevelopment. The project intends to incorporate local art installations aligned with local vision.","9076":"Duval601.2: Generators - Regular","5525":"Grenada206.2: Safe Room (Tornado and Severe Wind Shelter) - Public Structures","14935":"Aroostook403.1: Stormwater Management - Culverts","8032":"Roane200.1: Acquisition of Private Real Property (Structures and Land) - Riverine","17566":"Story206.2: Safe Room (Tornado and Severe Wind Shelter) - Public Structures","3141":"McClain600.1: Warning Systems (as a Component of a Planned, Adopted, and Exercised Risk Reduction Plan)","32156":"Marshall600.1: Warning Systems (as a Component of a Planned, Adopted, and Exercised Risk Reduction Plan)","4834":"Fayette601.1: Generators","1243":"Statewide602.1: Other Equipment Purchase and Installation","21582":"Skamania91.1: Local Multihazard Mitigation Plan","1597":"Platte601.1: Generators","6064":"Le Flore91.1: Local Multihazard Mitigation Plan","36358":"Blue Ridge Short Line Safety and Capacity Expansion Project: The proposed project involves final design and construction activities for various improvements to bridges and track-related components along BBLU\u2019s 72-mile rail network.

St. Louiss history is marked by divisions and racial disparities. The area surrounding the proposed crossing was severely impacted by displacement when Mill Creek Valley, a historically Black neighborhood, was demolished to allow construction of the interstate that is now I-64. The interstate remains a significant barrier, impeding access to new jobs, housing, services, healthcare, and public transit. The new Midtown I-64 Crossing and the Brickline Greenway as a whole redress this burden of harm, honor the history and character of the area, and create new pathways for area residents to access jobs and economic opportunities. When complete, the Brickline Greenway will include up to 20 miles of accessible multi-use greenways; current planning and construction focuses on 10 miles of greenways.

What was once a convenient and well-connected community suddenly found itself faced with a significant barrier, disrupting daily routines, and altering the dynamics of everyday life. While some of the roads crossing US Hwy 20 to the north and south of the city remained open as at-grade crossings when the highway was originally constructed, the Idaho Transportation Department has closed all but one of these at-grade crossings to improve safety and traffic flow along US 20. This improvement in safety along the corridor came at an inequitable cost to the local population. Along the fourteen miles of US 20 through Madison County, there were approximately twenty roads that were bisected and essentially closed because of the new highway. The City of Rexburg intends to have a professional company research, assess, design, and plan the best options for reconnecting the disadvantaged communities that lie on the west side of Highway 20 with the town amenities that are necessary and important for daily living. Options include under or over passes at three different locations that would provide the most direct paths for both automobiles and bike\/pedestrian paths. The goal is to explore environmentally sensitive options to reconnect the communities to the west of US 20 with the city, reduce traffic congestion through the existing interchanges, enhance pedestrian and bicycle mobility across the US 20 barrier, and address future travel demand. There are three streets that have been identified as the most critical to reconnect. This project is strong in the area of Facility Suitability.","35806":"The Regional Transportation Commission of Washoe County to plan for TOD at 12 bus rapid transit stations along the Virginia Line South Extension_NV: The Regional Transportation Commission of Washoe County will receive funding to plan for TOD at 12 bus rapid transit stations along the Virginia Line South Extension.","29938":"Lake200.1: Acquisition of Private Real Property (Structures and Land) - Riverine","9565":"Chittenden301.1: Shoreline Stabilization (Riprap, etc.)","25585":"Lowndes206.2: Safe Room (Tornado and Severe Wind Shelter) - Public Structures","12315":"Bryan91.1: Local Multihazard Mitigation Plan","23334":"Asotin91.3: Local Multihazard Mitigation Plan - UPDATE","22050":"Liberty200.1: Acquisition of Private Real Property (Structures and Land) - Riverine","6232":"","13422":"Monroe205.8: Retrofitting Public Structures - Wind","30306":"Lake206.2: Safe Room (Tornado and Severe Wind Shelter) - Public Structures","5936":"Okaloosa402.1: Infrastructure Protective Measures (Roads and Bridges)","25773":"Statewide90.6: Mitigation Plan - State Multihazard Mitigation Plan","7407":"Edgecombe200.1: Acquisition of Private Real Property (Structures and Land) - Riverine","24320":"Bucks200.1: Acquisition of Private Real Property (Structures and Land) - Riverine","21440":"Wyoming200.6: Acquisition of Private Real Property (Structures and Land) - Landslide","32240":"Winneshiek200.1: Acquisition of Private Real Property (Structures and Land) - Riverine","19922":"Putnam91.1: Local Multihazard Mitigation Plan","7147":"Nassau91.5: Local Multijurisdictional Multihazard Mitigation Plan - UPDATE","3248":"Trumbull904.1: Advanced Assistance","28332":"Jefferson202.1: Elevation of Private Structures - Riverine","19087":"Cowley206.2: Safe Room (Tornado and Severe Wind Shelter) - Public Structures","10529":"Marquette91.3: Local Multihazard Mitigation Plan - UPDATE","21971":"Barbour200.1: Acquisition of Private Real Property (Structures and Land) - Riverine","10030":"Statewide700.1: Management Costs - Salaries","23640":"Statewide202.1: Elevation of Private Structures - Riverine; \n202.1A: RETRO - Elevation of Private Structures - Riverine; \n202.2: Elevation of Private Structures - Coastal; \n202.2A: RETRO - Elevation of Private Structures - Coastal; \n207.1: Mitigation Reconstruction - PILOT; \n207.1A: RETRO - Mitigation Reconstruction - PILOT","36246":"City of Annapolis_MD_Electric or Low Emitting Ferry Pilot Program: The City of Annapolis will receive funding to initiate passenger ferry service between the city's downtown and Eastport by buying two battery electric vessels and charging equipment and making improvements to the two docks.

The study will look at the feasibility of various reconfigurations to find the best options, including through traffic studies, surveys, an Interchange Access Report, a feasibility analysis, preliminary design and engineering, a permitting analysis, and cost estimation, all of which will be informed by community engagement. The African American St. Paul\u2019s, Elizabeth River waterfront, and historically Black Norfolk State University neighborhoods bore the brunt of impacts from past infrastructure projects, particularly from this massive segment of the 14-lane wide interstate. Upon completion, I-264's retroactive placement in downtown Norfolk cut off Black neighborhoods, public housing communities, and anchor institutions from downtown opportunities that include job centers, educational hubs, transportation resources and cultural institutions. The legacy impacts of this are still felt today in the form of high unemployment, high poverty levels and low educational attainment. The applicant clearly indicates with historical context and documentation that this planning study will be used to address the social inequity, and racial and economic disparities created due to the construction of the I-264 freeway and freeway ramps. The project addresses the present connectivity challenges and resulting inequities that have resulted from I-264 as a point of disconnect to Norfolk\u2019s economically distressed neighborhoods. Furthermore, information is provided emphasizing the impact of redlining for the St. Paul neighborhood, the lack of affordable\/quality food markets, poor access to health resources, and high poverty that segregates this community from opportunities afforded to higher resourced areas of Norfolk.","752":"Huntingdon202.1: Elevation of Private Structures - Riverine","25158":"Tioga202.1: Elevation of Private Structures - Riverine","24293":"Tulsa91.1: Local Multihazard Mitigation Plan","33504":"Cedar601.2: Generators - Regular","16908":"Statewide91.1: Local Multihazard Mitigation Plan; \n92.1: State Multihazard Mitigation Plan","27531":"Kodiak Island205.6: Structural Retrofitting\/Rehabilitating Public Structures - Seismic","27223":"Yolo301.1: Shoreline Stabilization (Riprap, etc.)","27315":"Richland200.1: Acquisition of Private Real Property (Structures and Land) - Riverine","5064":"Jefferson405.1: Other Minor Flood Control","15254":"Allegheny200.1: Acquisition of Private Real Property (Structures and Land) - Riverine","7912":"","18963":"Harding91.1: Local Multihazard Mitigation Plan","4252":"Mercer400.1: Utility Protective Measures (Electric, Gas, etc.); \n401.1: Water and Sanitary Sewer System Protective Measures","30754":"Holmes600.1: Warning Systems (as a Component of a Planned, Adopted, and Exercised Risk Reduction Plan)","14837":"Stephens601.1: Generators","15503":"Pasco202.1: Elevation of Private Structures - Riverine","10673":"St. Croix502.1: Tsunami Vertical Evacuation Shelter","29841":"Windham402.1: Infrastructure Protective Measures (Roads and Bridges)","25584":"Jefferson601.2: Generators - Regular","13144":"Beaufort202.2: Elevation of Private Structures - Coastal","19543":"Dauphin200.1: Acquisition of Private Real Property (Structures and Land) - Riverine","4122":"Statewide700.1: Management Costs - Salaries; \n700.4: Management Costs - Supplies","32264":"Marion205.8: Retrofitting Public Structures - Wind","5452":"Oconto200.1: Acquisition of Private Real Property (Structures and Land) - Riverine","7073":"Lauderdale206.1: Safe Room (Tornado and Severe Wind Shelter) - Private Structures","6857":"Franklin91.1: Local Multihazard Mitigation Plan","4564":"Galveston200.2: Acquisition of Private Real Property (Structures and Land) - Coastal","33087":"Assumption103.2: Feasibility, Engineering, and Design Studies - Safe Rooms; \n206.2: Safe Room (Tornado and Severe Wind Shelter) - Public Structures","14950":"Morris200.1: Acquisition of Private Real Property (Structures and Land) - Riverine","14557":"Coffee91.5: Local Multijurisdictional Multihazard Mitigation Plan - UPDATE","36638":"Beaverton Downtown Loop Complete Street Project: This planning project will design wider sidewalks, protected bike lanes, new bus stops, and signal and intersection improvements along SW Hall Boulevard and SW Watson Street between SW Crescent Street and SW 5th Street.

The Project will reconnect Globeville & Elyria-Swansea (GES) neighborhoods by eliminating both natural and man-made barriers with construction of new bike, pedestrian, and greenway facilities and remediation of a large previously unusable brownfield site. Specifically, the Project will include four elements: (1) a new multimodal bridge over the South Platte River with a connective greenway corridor, (2) a new pedestrian bridge over the BNSF, DRIR, and RTD tracks connecting to RTDs transit station at Brighton Blvd, (3) construct at-grade railroad crossing safety improvements on National Western Drive, and (4) reclaim land for neighborhood uses. With these improvements, rather than relying solely on the high-speed roadways that serve I-70 to access the area, the nearly 700,000 visitors a year who attend the Stock Show every year and thousands of neighborhood residents will have access to an integrated network of pedestrian, bicycle, and transit infrastructure. Multiple planning studies have come together and determined re-connecting the GES neighborhoods will create positive proportional impacts to remedy past injustices. Globeville, located on the west bank of the South Platte River, has historically been a neighborhood of immigrants, originally Eastern Europeans, that were drawn to the emerging smelting industry located along the South Platte River, and thereafter Latinos and African Americans. While essential to the formation of these communities, the railroads and River, however, also serve as physical barriers between the neighborhoods and the expanding Denver city center to the south.

The rail line has posed a physical barrier to movement in the Rindge Avenue neighborhood for decades and created a demonstrated safety hazard, inhibiting local travel in one of the most diverse and lowest income block group areas of Cambridge. The scope of the project is to continue planning already underway and advance conceptual and final design of an overpass connecting the Rindge Avenue neighborhood, which has the highest proportion of affordable housing in the city, to Cambridges largest open space, Danehy Park, and improve access to stores, jobs, and transit. The project also includes planning and design for a multi-use path parallel to the rail line, creating connectivity to the crossing from many locations, as well as more convenient access to the nearby Alewife Red Line transit station. The planned bicycle and pedestrian bridge project will not only create dedicated, safe access from the Rindge Avenue neighborhood to Danehy Park, but will also create safer and more direct access to Fresh Pond Mall, which provides access to fresh groceries, clothing and other retail options, job opportunities and workforce training. Additionally, the bridge project will remove a key barrier to regional bicycle and pedestrian connectivity. Just to the north, the project will connect directly to Linear Park through Russell Field, the Minuteman Path, and the Somerville Community Path, and directly to the south, will connect to the Danehy-New Street Connector path and the Watertown Cambridge Greenway. This will create a direct, high quality, off-road route for hundreds of daily bicycle and pedestrian trips to major housing, retail, recreation, and jobs destinations in adjacent communities and regional destinations including Arlington Center, Arsenal Street in Watertown, the Charles River, Porter Square in Cambridge, Davis Square in Somerville, the Northpoint area in Cambridge, and Bostons downtown, North Station, and North End neighborhood.","23446":"","25710":"Statewide92.1: State Multihazard Mitigation Plan","34138":"Expand Access Road: Expand Access Road","11962":"Jefferson200.1: Acquisition of Private Real Property (Structures and Land) - Riverine","15650":"Latah403.4: Stormwater Management - Detention\/Retention Basins","15893":"Giles91.1: Local Multihazard Mitigation Plan","24340":"Bay200.3: Acquisition of Public Real Property (Structures and Land) - Riverine","7195":"Jackson200.1: Acquisition of Private Real Property (Structures and Land) - Riverine","22325":"","27384":"Arkansas700.1: Management Costs - Salaries","20719":"St. Lucie601.2: Generators - Regular","20218":"St. Tammany200.1: Acquisition of Private Real Property (Structures and Land) - Riverine","22955":"Boyle601.1: Generators","13229":"Nicollet400.1: Utility Protective Measures (Electric, Gas, etc.)","15606":"Somerset601.2: Generators - Regular; \n602.1: Other Equipment Purchase and Installation","21361":"Preble206.2: Safe Room (Tornado and Severe Wind Shelter) - Public Structures","11401":"","1232":"Sanborn400.1: Utility Protective Measures (Electric, Gas, etc.)","28969":"Harris200.1: Acquisition of Private Real Property (Structures and Land) - Riverine","24481":"","31229":"Tillamook403.1: Stormwater Management - Culverts","12036":"DeKalb200.1: Acquisition of Private Real Property (Structures and Land) - Riverine","4451":"Statewide700.1: Management Costs - Salaries","36049":"I-95 Exits 7-9: The Connecticut Department of Transportation will receive $1 million for a study to develop and examine preliminary alternatives for replacing the I-95 bridge near exits 7-9 through the City of Stamford.","36366":"Procurement and Retrofitting of Two Zero-Emission Lithium-Ion Battery Electric-Powered Locomotives Project: The proposed project involves final design and construction activities for two (2) zero emission lithium battery electric powered locomotives and associated charging technology installation.

These benefits will support culturally diverse, historically disadvantaged neighborhoods, including communities harmed by 20th century redlining, disproportionate environmental burdens, and disinvestment leading to high social vulnerability. Several years ago, neighboring residents began to advocate for the creative re-use of the rail line, recognizing the transformative opportunity offered by the facility. In 2011, they formed Friends of the Queensway - a grassroots group of residents and stakeholders \u2013 to advocate for their vision. This led to the development of the QueensWay plan, a conceptual plan for the linear park developed through a participatory engagement process that encompassed over 30 workshops and stakeholder meetings reaching hundreds of participants to investigate planning options through the lenses of urban design, ecological enhancement, public programming, park usership, safety, economic development, and governance models.

The project helps implement the Southbridge Transportation Action Plan (STAP), with the goal of improving safety and access for community residents by reducing truck volumes and improving walking, cycling, and access to public transit. More than 400 trucks pass through Southbridge daily, using neighborhood streets instead of larger roads for a more direct route to and from Downtown Wilmington. This has resulted in the community being burdened by pollution and poor health outcomes: it ranks it in the 90th percentile for high asthma rate and 89th and 92nd percentile for high diesel particulate matter pollution. In addition, the community is home of the census tract with the most traffic fatalities in the city, and 20% of the neighborhoods commuters walk or take public transit to work, which is four times the average for New Castle County.

The fundamental transportation challenge of the study area is that Highway 55 does not meet the modern safety and mobility choice needs of the people who travel the corridor and businesses that rely on it. Over the years, Highway 55 has created and contributed to barriers between neighborhoods and businesses as they have developed. In many cases, these barriers are disproportionately burdensome to pedestrians and bicyclists, and those who live along the corridor. Because of these disproportionate burdens, the highway as it has developed has contributed to social inequity. The Metropolitan Council received $250,000 from the Minnesota State Legislature in 2021 to study transit service improvements on Highway 55, including Bus Rapid Transit (BRT), between Medina and downtown Minneapolis. The Council is moving forward with this effort and is committed to coordinating with MnDOTs larger study of the overall transportation needs of the corridor. MnDOT will use grant funding to advance the Part I study into preliminary design along this section of Highway 55. The agency also will use the funding to enhance the BRT study and extend the study area west to include the cities of Golden Valley, Plymouth and Medina. This western expansion will officially begin \u201cPart II\u201d of the larger corridor study\u2014Highway 55: A Community Partnership, A Roadway for All. This project is strong in the areas of Equity & Environmental Justice and Community Engagement. Although the Technical Capacity Assessment review team gave this project a rating of Not Complete, the Department is confident that the Operating Administration overseeing the project will work closely with the recipient to implement the project in a manner that satisfies Federal requirements.","10377":"Los Angeles205.4: Non Structural Retrofitting\/Rehabilitating Public Structures - Seismic","17899":"Guam205.8: Retrofitting Public Structures - Wind","9833":"Monroe403.4: Stormwater Management - Detention\/Retention Basins","21779":"Harrison200.1: Acquisition of Private Real Property (Structures and Land) - Riverine; \n202.1: Elevation of Private Structures - Riverine","9126":"Coos90.4: Mitigation Plan - Local Multihazard Mitigation Plan","9554":"Davidson200.1: Acquisition of Private Real Property (Structures and Land) - Riverine","36633":"Reconnecting Neighborhoods in West Tulsa: The W. 51st Street Extension Project: The project will reconstruct approximately 1 mile of W. 51st Street, including a connection under US-75.

The Greening Chelsea Creek Waterfront Project will evaluate alternatives, choose a preferred alignment, and advance a concept design for a shared walking and biking path that will link together the two communities. Despite the industrial ties between these two communities, there is still a major disconnect between East Boston and Chelsea. Now, not only do natural barriers like Chelsea Creek divide the two communities, but anthropogenic influence has further divided the communities via an elevated expressway and interchange, a freight bypass road, former rail rights-of-way, and industrial-dominated streets and land uses. These physical barriers burden the surrounding disadvantaged communities with disproportionate air and noise pollution and consistent traffic safety concerns, most notably for those walking or biking. Both communities have been burdened with intractable logistical challenges and health complications, exacerbated by the car-centric and industrial landscape that has dominated the area for generations.","29251":"Midland91.2: Local Multihazard Mitigation Plan - NEW","24600":"Humboldt100.1: Public Awareness and Education (Brochures, Workshops, Videos, etc.)","1459":"Statewide700.1: Management Costs - Salaries; \n700.2: Management Costs - Equipment; \n700.3: Management Costs - Office Space Rental; \n700.4: Management Costs - Supplies","25608":"","31935":"Douglas401.1: Water and Sanitary Sewer System Protective Measures","25375":"W.

The prevalent issue of speeds exceeding the designated speed limits within the area and near schools makes traveling for those walking, biking, and with disabilities dangerous. Inadequate lighting for vulnerable users was also identified as a safety issue. Capital improvements along three corridors in the HIN include pedestrian hybrid beacons, leading pedestrian intervals, lighting, and pavement marking improvements, curb extensions, and traffic signal progression systems. The proposal also has a safety demonstration project near Hollingsworth STEAM Academy; a supplemental planning lighting study to improve safety; and supplemental planning walk audits near schools, parks, and senior centers.

Due to frequent at-grade train movements crossing the 21st Street Corridor, residents often wait up to 90 minutes at railroad crossings, leading residents to avoid the connection point and area altogether. These barriers also create a disconnection between two historically and culturally rich communities: the North End, home to Wichita\u2019s predominantly Hispanic Community, and North Wichita, home to some of Wichita\u2019s predominantly black communities. With the intention of reducing greenhouse gases, the project intends to introduce an east-west transit line, sidewalks, bike\/pedestrian pathways, solutions for persons with disabilities, and safe accommodation for all users. Improvements to the 21st Street Corridor would help reconnect the East and West End and facilitate access to daily destinations like grocery stores, medical facilities, after-school programs, and Wichita State University.

Manchester was one contiguous community as far back as 1843 but, because of this new highway, it was divided in two, with the land west of PA-65 named Chateau. While some housing was saved, the neighborhood\u2019s business districts and continuous street grid were lost to a combination of government demolition, riots, and the construction of PA-65. Manchester, a majority Black neighborhood in Pittsburgh, is home to a history of Victorian architecture, productive riverfronts and community organizing that thrived before PA-65's construction bisected the community. The highway was built on a viaduct that stands as tall as 40 feet above the surrounding streets, with only two openings for east-west travel between the two neighborhoods. The project will address the distribution of benefits and mitigation of impacts by exploring ways to remediate the harms done by mid-century policy. This includes exploring access improvement ideas through creative, sustainable, and equitable discussion with community members across the corridor. The application refers to the challenges of Manchester and Chateau as home to a higher concentration of people of color, lower incomes, and higher unemployment than the surrounding areas. Manchester has demonstrated the need for better access to jobs that offer a living wage as well as goods and services. A significant number of residents both do not own a car and live more than a half-mile from the nearest grocery store. The application discusses the negative impacts resulting from the construction and operation of PA-65 corridor and how alternatives would increase mobility and connectivity for better access to daily destinations, including grocery stores, recreation, businesses, and parks.","6210":"Pinellas200.2: Acquisition of Private Real Property (Structures and Land) - Coastal","19011":"Jackson206.2: Safe Room (Tornado and Severe Wind Shelter) - Public Structures","9589":"Island700.4: Management Costs - Supplies; \n91.5: Local Multijurisdictional Multihazard Mitigation Plan - UPDATE; \n96.1: Public Awareness and Education (Brochures, Workshops, Videos, etc.)","3553":"Lancaster904.1: Advanced Assistance","18690":"Morris601.2: Generators - Regular; \n602.1: Other Equipment Purchase and Installation","16060":"Statewide200.2: Acquisition of Private Real Property (Structures and Land) - Coastal","31143":"Etowah206.1: Safe Room (Tornado and Severe Wind Shelter) - Private Structures","1352":"","14070":"Ben Hill103.1: Feasibility, Engineering and Design Studies; \n403.1: Stormwater Management - Culverts","26627":"Bleckley91.5: Local Multijurisdictional Multihazard Mitigation Plan - UPDATE","34174":"Improve\/Modify\/Rehabilitate Terminal Building: Improve\/Modify\/Rehabilitate Terminal Building","18897":"St. Lucie205.8: Retrofitting Public Structures - Wind","14863":"Statewide205.8: Retrofitting Public Structures - Wind","3691":"Polk600.1: Warning Systems (as a Component of a Planned, Adopted, and Exercised Risk Reduction Plan)","13191":"Mayes91.3: Local Multihazard Mitigation Plan - UPDATE","31981":"Winston206.2: Safe Room (Tornado and Severe Wind Shelter) - Public Structures","31779":"San Bernardino401.1: Water and Sanitary Sewer System Protective Measures","34079":"Construct\/Modify\/Improve\/Rehabilitate Hangar: Construct\/Modify\/Improve\/Rehabilitate Hangar","14810":"Burlington601.2: Generators - Regular","36828":"US 212 Freight Mobility & Safety Project Minnesota: The project will expand approximately 5 miles of US 212 from a rural two-lane undivided highway to a four-lane divided expressway between CSAH 36 in Cologne to Tacoma Avenue, including construction of reduced conflict intersections and a grade-separated interchange.","32304":"McMinn200.1: Acquisition of Private Real Property (Structures and Land) - Riverine","36803":"Corpus Christi International Airport_TX_Airport Terminal Program: This project will modernize restrooms to include mother's rooms and service animal relief areas for Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) compliance.

Nationally recognized as an exemplary model of a community reconnecting highway-to_x0002_boulevard approach, the project is one of the two singled out by President Biden in his 2021 speech introducing Build Back Better as an example of infrastructure built on the principles of justice, jobs, and safety. After a decade of planning and community engagement, City, County, and State officials are moving forward together to make the vision of reconnecting and transforming the community a reality through the construction of the projects selected alternative, the Community Grid, which reimagines the transportation network in part by dispersing traffic onto local streets and transforming those neighborhood streets into a complete network encouraging active transportation. A key feature of the Community Grid is Business Loop (BL) 81, which in Downtown Syracuse will be a signalized complete street designed to meet the needs of all users. The complementary initiatives led by New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) and the City of Syracuse will improve Almond Street, also referred to as the new BL 81, and other multimodal improvements along state and city streets. The new BL 81\/Almond Street will increase connections to Downtown, improve traffic flow, connect residents - including those in affordable housing located on either side of Almond Street - with local jobs, enhance safety and equity, and boost economic opportunity across Central New York. Enhanced connections and added active transportation and placemaking elements in the community, including sidewalks, bike paths, new shared use paths, and enhanced and new parks and public spaces, will further reconnect and reinvigorate the neighborhoods.","16971":"Antelope400.1: Utility Protective Measures (Electric, Gas, etc.)","22348":"Weber205.6: Structural Retrofitting\/Rehabilitating Public Structures - Seismic","2578":"Dubuque200.1: Acquisition of Private Real Property (Structures and Land) - Riverine","18049":"Houston206.1: Safe Room (Tornado and Severe Wind Shelter) - Private Structures","8378":"Clackamas205.6: Structural Retrofitting\/Rehabilitating Public Structures - Seismic","21643":"Statewide91.1: Local Multihazard Mitigation Plan","27903":"Harrison601.2: Generators - Regular","25675":"Sawyer200.1: Acquisition of Private Real Property (Structures and Land) - Riverine","19845":"St. Lucie103.1: Feasibility, Engineering and Design Studies; \n403.2: Stormwater Management - Diversions","19140":"Statewide700.1: Management Costs - Salaries; \n700.2: Management Costs - Equipment; \n700.3: Management Costs - Office Space Rental; \n700.4: Management Costs - Supplies","5283":"Statewide700.1: Management Costs - Salaries","28687":"","26610":"Whatcom200.6: Acquisition of Private Real Property (Structures and Land) - Landslide","37708":"Complete, Connected, Resilient Communities: Gulfton & Kashmere Gardens Resilient Sidewalks Project: The Complete, Connected, Resilient Communities: Gulfton & Kashmere Gardens Resilient Sidewalks Project will work to address historic underinvestment and barriers in two Houston neighborhoods by improving sidewalks, drainage, and tree cover, which will work together to create climate-resilient streets that support a multimodal mobility network.

Sidewalks in the Gulfton and Kashmere Gardens communities are intermittent or nonexistent, which creates safety concerns and barriers for all people, including students, elderly, and those with disabilities. There are few trees to provide relief from heat, improve air quality, or restore mental health. Flooding is a consistent concern among people who have few resources.

The project aims to support pre-construction tasks for the Airport Wash Greenway, while the major scope of the project is to construct a new bicycle and pedestrian bridge over I-19 to Nebraska Street. In the early 1960s, the social fabric of several diverse, largely Hispanic South Tucson Neighborhoods were severed by the construction of I-19. Residents who previously had direct access to the Santa Cruz River and strong connections to other parts of Tucson became isolated, trapped behind the walls of a freeway. With over a quarter of the population living in poverty, this has led to over 60 years of South Tucson residents being exposed to air and noise pollution and living in a food desert, while being cut-off from economic opportunity with especially limited bicycle and pedestrian access. The City of Tucson provided a detailed description of a Hispanic community which is also an area of persistent poverty. The community continues to be negatively impacted by the bifurcation of I-19, which severely restricts movement, and access to essential medical facilities and other services. Currently, residents of this underserved community, which includes a significant population of vulnerable road users, experience major safety hazards due to their limited ability to navigate across the highway. The infrastructure that provides the ability to cross the barrier is spaced at more than one mile apart.","324":"James City202.2: Elevation of Private Structures - Coastal","6780":"Statewide205.3: Non Structural Retrofitting\/Rehabilitating Private Structures - Seismic","11431":"Wicomico904.1: Advanced Assistance","36929":"CSX\/SEPTA Grade Crossing Elimination Study \u2013 A Study to Alleviate Congestion and Enhance Community Safety: This proposed planning project will initiate a crossing elimination study for three at-grade crossings on CSX\/SEPTA lines that experience congestion and delays in the Philadelphia region.

It cut through the heart of 14 historical Black neighborhoods, including Faubourg Trem\u00e9 neighborhood, the oldest free Black community in the country. It decimated a thriving commercial corridor, closing 326 Black_x0002_owned businesses along Claiborne Avenue. The purpose of this planning and feasibility study is to build upon the results of previous planning efforts to develop and evaluate proposed improvement alternatives that seek to address environmental, socioeconomic, and transportation-related inequities along Claiborne Avenue, while maintaining operations and safety for interstate traffic. Reconnecting Claiborne is comprised of three major elements: (1) The creation of the Claiborne Innovation District; (2) I-10 overpass improvements; and (3) On-ramp and off-ramp removal. The planning study will consider meaningful public involvement and technical capacity associated with these components. The project aims to promote community-based stewardship by preserving and renewing the cultural heritage of the Claiborne Corridor. For generations, the corridor has been home to culture bearers such as artists, musicians, social club members, the Black or Mardi Gras Indians, and entrepreneurs of the informal market that exists below the I-10 bridge. There has been extensive community engagement that will be carried out further for this study. Formal partnerships and support, substantiated through signed commitment letters, include the City of New Orleans, Ujamaa EDC, Greater New Orleans Inc., Housing LOUISIANA, Housing NOLA, the Greater New Orleans Housing Alliance, and the Claiborne Avenue Merchants and Business Association.","5990":"Statewide700.1: Management Costs - Salaries","36732":"M-90 Transbay Marine Highway Equipment Acquisition Project: The America\u2019s Marine Highway Grant funds will go towards acquisition of three types of equipment that will facilitate the safe, sustainable, and efficient transfer of project cargoes from shore to vessel and back to shore.

The Project would rectify the historical inequities caused by Route 16, Route 99, and Main Street traveling through Everett by developing bicycle and pedestrian facilities and understanding potential opportunities for the expansion of the Silver Line. Today Sweetser Circle and Revere Beach Parkway inhibit non-roadway access to Orange Line stations in Somerville and Medford. Accessing these stations by walking or cycling is unsafe and unpleasant for residents, given the high-speed traffic of vehicles and lack of safe facilities. The Uniting Neighborhoods and Transit Opportunities in Everett Project is intended to address the harm caused by busy, high-speed roadways and active railway bisecting Everett neighborhoods, including harm to public health and the environment through heavy air pollution, in an already marginalized, underserved, and overburdened environmental justice community. This planning study will consider accommodations for future Silver Line (MBTA Bus Rapid Transit) expansion, siting of a Commuter Rail stop, connections to existing bicycle facilities (Northern Strand Trail, Wellington Trail, and more), open green space, and connections between the Lower and Upper Broadway neighborhoods with new and improved pedestrian and bicycle facilities.

The Bonneville Metropolitan Planning Organization (BMPO) is applying for a Neighborhood Access and Equity (NAE) Community Planning Grant, to complete the US-20 Reconnecting Neighborhoods Project for the areas impacted by US-20. This planning study will identify and prioritize an array of projects to improve access and mobility across and along US-20 for those who walk, roll, and bike, reconnecting the currently disadvantaged communities to the City of Idaho Falls. The Project can significantly increase quality of life for the Historically Disadvantaged community by providing alternate mode options, improving health and air quality, reducing noise pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, and increasing greenspace and creative place-making. Extensive public outreach will be performed to ensure the community has a voice in the proposed improvements from the planning efforts. It will include extensive outreach and collaboration with the disadvantaged communities with a particular focus on in-person mediums. Art installations, along with improvements to the greenspace and additional recreational facilities, will encourage active transportation and tourism in the area, improving public health, developing the local economy, and reconnecting the neighborhoods.

More than 13,000 residences, 400 businesses, and 9 acres of a historic park were demolished. A major rapid transit rail line, today known as the Blue Line, was relocated into the highway median, centered within a 450-foot wide swath of expressway lanes and frontage roads. Tight-knit communities were displaced or scattered while the new expressway system catalyzed suburban development and white flight. The effect of these physical and societal forces left poor and minority residents in divided neighborhoods with reduced economic opportunities. Seven decades later, Chicagos West Side communities have never fully recovered. Funding will advance the City of Chicagos Reconnecting Chicagos West Side Communities Plan, aimed at addressing the adverse impacts of I-290 on the surrounding communities. The city will partner with and learn from community members to develop the plan, which will present a vision for improved connections that reflect the needs of the neighborhoods most impacted by I-290. Infrastructure improvements identified in the plan will promote safety and accessibility, support access to services, recreation, education, and economic opportunities, and serve as a source of pride for the residents in the study area. The city has already engaged community members and stakeholders for input on the approach to this plan. The I-290 expressway has been a physical barrier and a source of harmful environmental and health effects for residents of Chicagos West Side ever since its construction destroyed homes and businesses and displaced entire communities. Recognizing the harmful legacy of these past actions, the City of Chicago plans to set a new course by improving community safety, cohesion, and quality of life through a plan for enhanced connectivity over and around I-290 that serves the needs of residents living and working in these communities.","35424":"Livestock Fencing along Joe Show Road_MT: Livestock Fencing along Joe Show Road","30107":"Lake200.1: Acquisition of Private Real Property (Structures and Land) - Riverine","7594":"Franklin91.5: Local Multijurisdictional Multihazard Mitigation Plan - UPDATE","36724":"M-55\/M-35 Marine Highway Barge Project: The America\u2019s Marine Highway Grant funds will go toward the purchase of four modern, fuel-efficient, and environmentally friendly Hyster forklifts, a Manitowoc Cable Crane to load\/unload unitized cargo onto barges, and a barge winch system to load\/unload unitized cargo onto barges as well.

The adjacent neighborhoods are 80% minority with high poverty rates between 25%-35%. The project will identify and evaluate alternatives to reconnect the neighborhoods and address safety and mobility concerns. The Interchange poses a barrier for western Walkers Point residents to access the growing employment opportunities available in eastern Walkers Point. The Interchanges configuration and lack of connectivity substantially decreases the quality of life for the disadvantaged people living in western Walkers Point forced to contend with this unsafe Interchange daily. School children are forced to cross non-signaled intersections at freeway ramp terminals with high_x0002_speed traffic to get to and from school. The Interchange also generates cut-through, speeding traffic which creates conflict points and unsafe conditions for neighborhood residents to access Walker Square Park. This cut-through traffic generates safety concerns and crashes throughout the neighborhood and study area. WisDOT and its partners are prepared to rectify these concerns by reconfiguring the Interchanges ramps, connecting and completing local streets, adding bicycle and pedestrian paths, improving safety, creating land for mixed-use development, placemaking, improving access for those with a disability, and adding resiliency to this historically disadvantaged neighborhood. Through robust public engagement and technical analysis, the project will identify community concerns, create a collective vision, develop a range of improvement alternatives, and conduct a feasibility study that will investigate traffic, ramp geometries, street connections, shared use paths, and other potential improvements to reimagine the National Avenue interchange.","14277":"Jefferson206.2: Safe Room (Tornado and Severe Wind Shelter) - Public Structures","22657":"Statewide700.1: Management Costs - Salaries; \n700.2: Management Costs - Equipment; \n700.4: Management Costs - Supplies","17554":"San Mateo205.6: Structural Retrofitting\/Rehabilitating Public Structures - Seismic","38195":"SMART Rider: Equip transit vehicles with automated driver assistance system for collision avoidance.","12029":"Los Angeles205.6: Structural Retrofitting\/Rehabilitating Public Structures - Seismic","7399":"Washington106.1: Other Non Construction (Regular Project Only); \n205.7: Retrofitting Private Structures - Wind","29100":"San Diego904.1: Advanced Assistance","37519":"Reconnecting Northland-Arlington: The project replaces a railroad bridge overpass to allow for ADA accessible sidewalks and bicycle facilities, as well as improved sidewalks, accessible transit stops, and stormwater collection.","33209":"Beckham600.1: Warning Systems (as a Component of a Planned, Adopted, and Exercised Risk Reduction Plan)","34263":"Install Runway Vertical: Install Runway Vertical\/Visual Guidance System","4212":"Broome200.1: Acquisition of Private Real Property (Structures and Land) - Riverine","11180":"Warren601.1: Generators","26529":"Harris91.3: Local Multihazard Mitigation Plan - UPDATE","18938":"Calhoun600.1: Warning Systems (as a Component of a Planned, Adopted, and Exercised Risk Reduction Plan)","32352":"Choctaw601.1: Generators","3479":"Clinch600.1: Warning Systems (as a Component of a Planned, Adopted, and Exercised Risk Reduction Plan)","37796":"ReVISIONing Indian School Road: The City of Phoenix is awarded funding to implement intersection and pedestrian infrastructure changes and safety treatments along Indian School Road between 91st and 39th Avenues.

The Pyramid Lake Bike Path will provide a new multimodal facility that provides connectivity both within the tribal communities as well as connecting the communities to each other taking advantage of an old railroad bed known as the southern end of the \u201cModoc Line\u201d once operated by Southern Pacific Railroad. The railroad has been decommissioned with the tracks removed since about 1970 leaving the railroad bed, which has not been well maintained, is overgrown in many areas, and many of the creek and drainage bridge crossings have been washed out or removed. The old railroad bed creates access and safety issues as well as barriers for the community accessing beaches and other recreational areas on the reservation. The proposed PLPT Bike Path will transform the old railroad bed from a community barrier into a safe and sustainable multi-modal facility for residents traveling between the tribal communities of Sutcliffe and Nixon at Pyramid Lake and onto Wadsworth. The PLPT Bike Path will also support economic development for the Tribe, providing opportunities for new recreation and interpretive opportunities for visitors to learn about Pyramid Lake and the Tribes culture.","10384":"Los Angeles205.6: Structural Retrofitting\/Rehabilitating Public Structures - Seismic","17289":"Powell200.1: Acquisition of Private Real Property (Structures and Land) - Riverine","19909":"Scurry601.2: Generators - Regular","1065":"Tarrant200.1: Acquisition of Private Real Property (Structures and Land) - Riverine","28323":"Kay600.1: Warning Systems (as a Component of a Planned, Adopted, and Exercised Risk Reduction Plan)","10983":"","7384":"Lafourche91.1: Local Multihazard Mitigation Plan","19637":"Henry91.5: Local Multijurisdictional Multihazard Mitigation Plan - UPDATE","26219":"Plymouth200.2: Acquisition of Private Real Property (Structures and Land) - Coastal","23388":"Pike600.1: Warning Systems (as a Component of a Planned, Adopted, and Exercised Risk Reduction Plan)","1715":"","13973":"Beadle400.1: Utility Protective Measures (Electric, Gas, etc.)","23531":"StatewideFMA Plan","8245":"Riverside93.1: Tribal (Local) Multihazard Mitigation Plan","4662":"Nevada91.5: Local Multijurisdictional Multihazard Mitigation Plan - UPDATE","35757":"The Biddeford Saco Old Orchard Beach Transit Committee which serves Biddeford Saco and Old Orchard Beach to purchase onroute electric bus charging inf_ME: The Biddeford Saco Old Orchard Beach Transit Committee, which serves Biddeford, Saco and Old Orchard Beach, will receive funds to purchase on-route electric bus charging infrastructure.

The Project is located fully within underserved and disadvantaged communities in Baltimore and will generate significant benefits for residents who have historically been harmed by discriminatory transportation and housing policies, advancing the White Houses goals for racial equity. In response to grassroots community advocacy to create a safer, multi-modal corridor, the Baltimore City Department of Transportation (BCDOT) completed the Druid Park Lake Drive Complete Streets Feasibility Study in 2022, which developed concept-level designs for a corridor that is safe and accessible for people of all ages and abilities walking, biking, using mobility devices, and riding transit. This Project will build from that completed feasibility study and advance one concept through preliminary engineering.","14914":"Baltimore601.2: Generators - Regular","2465":"Matanuska-Susitna700.1: Management Costs - Salaries; \n700.3: Management Costs - Office Space Rental; \n700.4: Management Costs - Supplies","19719":"Jackson91.5: Local Multijurisdictional Multihazard Mitigation Plan - UPDATE","29971":"Harris800.1: Miscellaneous","15746":"Shoshone200.1: Acquisition of Private Real Property (Structures and Land) - Riverine","21084":"Columbia602.1: Other Equipment Purchase and Installation","34039":"Nashville International Airport: This award funds a portion of the lengthening and widening of the Terminal Access and Circulation Road from three to six lanes.","15309":"Rutherford100.1: Public Awareness and Education (Brochures, Workshops, Videos, etc.)","34984":"Rapid City Regional Airport: Expand Terminal Building","16077":"AtlanticFMA Plan","12525":"Clallam94.1: Tribal Multihazard Mitigation Plan","15428":"Guam400.1: Utility Protective Measures (Electric, Gas, etc.)","36130":"Southeastern Regional Transit Authority_MA_Low or No Emission Grant Program: Southeastern Regional Transit Authority will receive funding to buy hybrid electric buses to replace vehicles that have exceeded their useful life.

The project proposes to evaluate the impacts to the environment by permanently removing the Wilshire Blvd. Viaduct that bifurcates MacArthur Park in the most park poor community of Los Angeles and one of the most densely populated and disadvantaged areas of the City of Los Angeles and the State of California. Users of MacArthur Park are obligated to use underground tunnels that are ill-suited for pedestrians owing to its design, lack of maintenance, and public safety concerns as well as the fact that they are mostly gated. Instead, park users who are trying to access the other half of their park, must cross busy Wilshire Blvd. at Alvarado St. or Parkview St. which are a half mile apart. The roadway that divides the park also prevents the full usage of the park space for recreational activities. While the park currently has a small number of recreation options, the full reconnection of the park would present an opportunity for the City to reintroduce a higher number of community activities that would benefit a population that suffers from high rates of obesity, diabetes, and heart disease and lacks health insurance.","32914":"Nueces205.8: Retrofitting Public Structures - Wind","12731":"Finney91.1: Local Multihazard Mitigation Plan","24029":"Statewide600.1: Warning Systems (as a Component of a Planned, Adopted, and Exercised Risk Reduction Plan)","14498":"Salem (city)200.1: Acquisition of Private Real Property (Structures and Land) - Riverine","1176":"Washington200.1: Acquisition of Private Real Property (Structures and Land) - Riverine","5432":"Fajardo601.1: Generators","31878":"","7343":"Craven202.1: Elevation of Private Structures - Riverine","9895":"Putnam601.2: Generators - Regular","26544":"Watonwan91.1: Local Multihazard Mitigation Plan","16738":"Woodford91.1: Local Multihazard Mitigation Plan","8686":"","24398":"Pitt200.1: Acquisition of Private Real Property (Structures and Land) - Riverine","25313":"Harrison601.2: Generators - Regular","26648":"Miami-Dade205.8: Retrofitting Public Structures - Wind","28271":"Harris403.5: Floodwater Storage and Diversion","37134":"San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency_CA_Buses and Bus Facilities Competitive Program: The San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency will receive funding to buy and install charging equipment at two bus yards to help transition its fleet to battery-electric buses.

The railroad line historically functioned as a demarcation line for the \u201ccolor line\u201d ordinance enacted in the city in the 1920s to restrict Black residents to the northwestern side of the FEC and continues to be a barrier to those communities. The FEC separates the historically Black neighborhoods of Fort Lauderdale from the wealthier areas in the eastern part of the city. In addition, most services, and facilities such as hospitals, schools, grocery stores, parks, and entertainment venues, are in the east side. The at-grade crossings create dangerous conditions for travelers, especially for vulnerable road users such as pedestrians and cyclists as the crossings lack sidewalks and bike lanes. Currently, train crossings amount to up to five-minute delays in travel times for travelers, and the amount of daily train crossings is expected to increase by 70% due to the development of the Broward Commuter Rail (BCR). Broward Metropolitan Planning Organization proposes the elimination of highway-rail grade crossings by tunneling underpasses for improved access to west side residents. The tunnels will add dedicated sidewalks and bike lanes at each intersection to address current safety and access needs, and in preparation of the opening of new BCR stations at two of the intersections identified by this project. Expected walk and bike accessibility improvements are expected to reach 12,000 and 100,000 residents, respectively.","16289":"","27432":"Harrison200.1: Acquisition of Private Real Property (Structures and Land) - Riverine","7193":"Statewide700.1: Management Costs - Salaries; \n700.2: Management Costs - Equipment; \n700.4: Management Costs - Supplies","6276":"","17083":"Chenango202.1: Elevation of Private Structures - Riverine","6743":"Collier205.8: Retrofitting Public Structures - Wind","13940":"Statewide106.1: Other Non Construction (Regular Project Only)","20828":"Camden91.5: Local Multijurisdictional Multihazard Mitigation Plan - UPDATE","28163":"San Diego91.1: Local Multihazard Mitigation Plan","22523":"Placer500.1: Flood Control - Floodwall","13240":"Grafton200.1: Acquisition of Private Real Property (Structures and Land) - Riverine","10826":"Los Angeles205.4: Non Structural Retrofitting\/Rehabilitating Public Structures - Seismic","23705":"Bay205.8: Retrofitting Public Structures - Wind","36208":"Idaho Department of Transportation_ID_Buses and Bus Facilities Competitive Program: The Idaho Department of Transportation will receive funding on behalf of Mountain Rides in Blaine County to buy commuter vans.

The feasibility study will examine truck routes and the harmful community impacts of truck traffic in the downtown area of the City of Watsonville and beyond. The study will include a focus on improving safety for active transportation modes, expanding multi-modal use throughout Watsonville, and reducing emissions close to schools and residential neighborhoods. Trucking routes were established decades ago to connect vital highways and networks for freight. SR 152 was extended into Watsonville in 1933 and SR 129 became a state highway and official truck route in 1964. Both major arterials bisect the city center. In the past sixty years the City of Watsonville has expanded around these, and other routes and the freight use of these corridors has expanded. The city has had the burden of accepting heavy freight throughout the city putting pedestrians, cyclists, and school children at risk. The speed and high volume of truck traffic on these truck routes have restricted economic development, added to the pollution burden, and are related to the citys unacceptably high injury and fatality rates. The Neighborhood Access and Equity grant funding would fund a feasibility study to examine truck routes and the harmful community impacts of truck traffic in the downtown region and beyond. The study would include a focus on improving safety for active transportation modes and expanding multi-modal use throughout Watsonville, reducing emissions close to schools and residential neighborhoods. The study will evaluate alternative truck routes and a range of alternative design options along each street corridor to address the long-term burden that these routes have imposed on the growth and development of the city. The study aims to eliminate barriers and effectively reconnect the community providing safe, comfortable, and healthy networks that connect necessary destination points in the neighborhoods and in downtown.","194":"Ventura105.1: Applied Research and Development in the Building Sciences","27074":"Faulkner91.5: Local Multijurisdictional Multihazard Mitigation Plan - UPDATE","37420":"Ashley Municipal Airport_ND_Airport Terminal Program: This award funds a project to construct a new 500 square feet general aviation terminal building for passengers and flight crews.

These improvements will collectively be referred to as \u201cthe Project\u201d throughout this application. The Project will be built in and serve the historically disadvantaged community of East L.A. The East L.A. neighborhood was divided by the construction of I-710 in the 1960s. I-710 is a north-south barrier that bisects the east and west sides of East L.A., posing a significant barrier for those traveling on foot or by bike, as shown in Figure 1. I-710 is a designated truck and freight route that is heavily used to transport goods to and from the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, connecting to destinations throughout the national and globe. When constructed, the Project will provide a dedicated, safe pedestrian\/cyclist route reconnecting the East L.A. neighborhood. The Crossing will be the only crossing of I-710 dedicated to pedestrians and cyclists within 10 miles of the Project. Additional improvements include new sidewalks and Americans with Disabilities Act-compliant ramps, which will increase the comfort, ease, and safety of people accessing the Project overcrossing and neighborhood destinations. The Project will create a direct, safe connection to Humphreys Avenue Elementary School for students who must cross I-710 to get to school.

The three bridges represent key connectivity features of the Citys larger transformational multimodal connectivity project, the DOT funded Pedestrian Access and Redevelopment Corridor (PARC). With continued support from DOT, the city will mitigate the transportation barriers posed by Memorial Parkway and Governors Drive which have historically isolated the Mill Creek Choice Neighborhood from safe access to economic opportunities in Downtown Huntsville. Located in the Mill Creek Choice Neighborhood, the proposed project will provide critical pedestrian and bicycle connections, allowing physically isolated residents in a low-income neighborhood and public housing developments to safely access the ever-growing number of businesses, industries, retail, employment opportunities, and services located in downtown Huntsville. The proposed project is found in census tracts 31, 21, and 12 which are identified as an area of persistent poverty and a historically disadvantaged community. According to an online survey issued by the City in 2017, 82% of respondents indicated that they would use the bridge project to walk and 47.5% would bike but noted that the reason they currently do not walk, or bike is because of the lack of trail connectivity and traffic speed. This project would mitigate inequity caused by the construction of the Memorial Parkway in 1955. Initially a four-lane highway, Memorial Parkway was viewed as the solution to the citys traffic and transportation infrastructure problem that directly aligned with the Citys urban renewal plan. However, to make way for Memorial Parkway, the Citys urban renewal plan also called for razing Black homes downtown and in Black business districts. As the homes in what is now the Mill Creek Choice Neighborhood were demolished in the late 1950s and into the 1960s, so too were Black businesses, as the City of Huntsville utilized federal \u201cslum clearance\u201d and blight mitigation funds to justify the displacement of hundreds of Black residents.","27891":"","19085":"Otoe601.2: Generators - Regular","29915":"","10609":"Statewide90.4: Mitigation Plan - Local Multihazard Mitigation Plan","33956":"Eastport Municipal Airport: This award funds the construction of a new terminal to replace the existing building which was removed in 2018.","19322":"St. Lucie601.2: Generators - Regular","10513":"Los Angeles205.4: Non Structural Retrofitting\/Rehabilitating Public Structures - Seismic","31671":"Somerset403.1: Stormwater Management - Culverts","33630":"Suffolk500.1: Flood Control - Floodwall","22505":"Perry90.4: Mitigation Plan - Local Multihazard Mitigation Plan","1166":"Norfolk202.2: Elevation of Private Structures - Coastal","37967":"Town of Rising Sun Vision Zero Safety Action Plan: This award will be used by the Town of Rising Sun to develop a comprehensive safety action plan.","8375":"Orange205.6: Structural Retrofitting\/Rehabilitating Public Structures - Seismic","2980":"Clay205.8: Retrofitting Public Structures - Wind","2294":"Statewide92.2: State Multihazard Mitigation Plan - UPDATE","36978":"City of Akron, Ohio - Reconnecting Communities Pilot Grant Program: Funds will be used to create a community-based master plan to guide the transformation of a vacated mile-long section of Akron's Innerbelt (State Route 59) into an asset that benefits all Akron residents. The master plan will look at short- and long-term strategies to address the challenges posed by the Innerbelt, which was never fully completed and is underutilized. Sometimes referred to as \u201cAkron\u2019s Road to Nowhere,\u201d the Innerbelt never saw the promises of revitalization that came with its construction. Once a booming community thanks to the rubber industry, this highway split several existing Black neighborhoods in half, displacing thousands of residents from more than 700 homes while closing or relocating over 100 local businesses. The City of Akron has already created a thirteen-member Innerbelt Advisory group, which meets monthly, and has hired a contractor to conduct dialogues with the affected residents, some of whom are members the advisory group. The application mentions that seven census tracts in the affected area are low to moderate income. The application also includes 11 letters of support from businesses and community organizations, including financial support from a private foundation. The application describes multiple ways to improve the mobility and community connectivity in the area, including reconnecting the street grid, promoting multi-modal transportation, providing infill housing on the site, removing roadways, and calming traffic on frontage roads. It also discusses including trails, green space, and public art. The project intends to create a master plan rooted in community visioning to promote equitable development, possibly including infill development on the vacated highway, including affordable housing and local business development with attention to the area\u2019s history.","13466":"Fall River91.1: Local Multihazard Mitigation Plan","34657":"Construct Taxiway [BIL AIG - Construct taxilane and construction phase engineering services], Construct: Construct Taxiway [BIL AIG - Construct taxilane and construction phase engineering services], Construct\/Modify\/Improve\/Rehabilitate Hangar [BIL AIG - Construct 2 bay T-hangar], Construct\/Modify\/Improve\/Rehabilitate Hangar [BIL AIG - Construction Phase Engineering Services], Construct\/Modify\/Improve\/Rehabilitate Hangar [BIL AIG - Construction of two hangar units and taxilane approaches.

The study, Our Future 35: Connecting Austin Equitably Mobility Study, focuses on 8 miles of the I-35 corridor from US 290 (north) to SH 71 (south). I-35 is a physical barrier that reinforces and exacerbates the discriminatory zoning, redlining, and other biased policies that segregated low-income and minority communities, separated them from access to opportunity, and imposed disproportionate environmental impacts on them. The study will identify affordable housing, anti-displacement and business support strategies for neighborhoods surrounding new freeway caps, identify transportation equity-focused action items, develop a placemaking plan, and evaluate transportation-related health and environmental justice concerns, and recommend mitigation for impacted neighborhoods. East Avenue, where I-35 stands today, was once a vibrant gathering place for Austin\u2019s historically Black and Mexican populations - a boulevard known for its park-like, tree-lined medians that were once used for family picnics, conversations, musical performances and sporting events. Constructed mid-century, I-35 was built atop the East Avenue right-of-way, transforming a surface-level street into an elevated highway that ended up dividing East and West Austin. Since that time, it has been a primary driver of segregation and disparity and presents a major roadblock to access, mobility, and economic opportunity. This study would coincide with the current TxDOT NEPA\/design of the I-35 corridor and provide additional input from the surrounding communities towards determining where highway caps and freeway crossings will be included in the design. The group has already coordinated with the local transit authority to include transit route studies to provide equitable access to the historically disadvantaged communities and mentions multimodal mobility options to communities adjacent to I-35 that are a key component of the study. The proposed freeway caps will provide an opportunity for community placemaking, and the application discusses that placemaking will be a priority of the study.","30944":"Carter206.2: Safe Room (Tornado and Severe Wind Shelter) - Public Structures","37215":"White Earth Reservation Business Committee_MN_Low or No Emission Grant Program: White Earth Public Transit will receive funding to buy low-emission buses with electronic farebox systems to replace older vehicles.

The Stitch capping project acknowledges the past displacement of historic Black neighborhoods of Buttermilk Bottom and Butler Street from jobs and services in Downtown Atlanta. It will also provide new connections that will enhance access to jobs, housing, education, and healthcare. The City of Atlanta and Georgia DOT are committed project partners with additional funding support from Atlanta Regional Commission. The Community Improvement District has also dedicated $3 million to-date in this project. A nonprofit organization, whose Governing Board includes representatives from the community, will guide the development of the park capping Interstate 75\/85. Emory University also indicated its commitment and support to the park capping project as it will improve access to Emory University Hospital Midtown from Downtown. This project could result in more transit, walking, and biking trips through prioritizing zero and lower carbon modes of travel within the project area.

This half-mile facility includes paths around a cloverleaf to a bridge over Interstate 89 (I-89). With six lanes of traffic, the I-89 Exit 14 cloverleaf interchange is challenging for all users. In response to the access and safety issues present at the interstate interchange, which has the highest Average Daily Travel (ADT) and is the most congested in the state, the City of South Burlington is undertaking construction of a separated, non-vehicular crossing. This project will increase walking and bicycling connectivity. It will link the regions housing, employers, retail centers, medical center, universities, schools, and municipal services. There are no easily implemented reconfigurations to remedy Exit 14s structural deficiencies. This project is essential to creating a functional regional network for walking, cycling and rolling. By mitigating this physical barrier of the interchange and interstate, the Crossing will provide a safe alternative for people on foot or non-motorized conveyance to reach destinations to the east and west of Exit 14. This new path and bridge provide an accessible, grade separated route. The project is ADA accessible, provides resting places, is designed to feel safe at all hours and be maintainable in all seasons, and be welcoming. Wayfinding will help orient users. Designed with bicycles as well as pedestrians in mind the project features gentle curves and cues to foster respectful passing while supporting active transportation.","31401":"Hampden601.1: Generators","8485":"Clatsop400.1: Utility Protective Measures (Electric, Gas, etc.); \n602.1: Other Equipment Purchase and Installation","17032":"Clayton91.1: Local Multihazard Mitigation Plan","31796":"Lincoln206.2: Safe Room (Tornado and Severe Wind Shelter) - Public Structures","21879":"Greenbrier200.1: Acquisition of Private Real Property (Structures and Land) - Riverine","855":"Klamath205.4: Non Structural Retrofitting\/Rehabilitating Public Structures - Seismic","36428":"Atlanta-Chattanooga-Nashville-Memphis Corridor: The proposed corridor would connect Atlanta, GA, to Chattanooga, Nashville, and Memphis, TN.

The project will also provide new bicycle and pedestrian routes and establish a Community Advisory Committee to provide input, feedback, and help guide the equitable implementation of the project. The goals of this project are to eliminate the barrier between Downtown Tampa and its riverfront, reconnect Tampa\u2019s historic street grid, and bolster safe and direct active transportation access, like walking and biking, in Downtown Tampa. Prior to the construction of Ashely Drive and I-275, the Hillsborough area was an epicenter of Black business and culture for the greater Tampa area. The project\u2019s construction in 1951 created an impassible barrier that severed downtown Tampa\u2019s historic street grid and routed high-speed regional traffic directly into Tampa\u2019s urban core. While this produced a new, auto-centric gateway into downtown Tampa, it also began decades of economic and social isolation for the historically Black neighborhoods it separated. The City of Tampa will use the Reconnecting Communities funds to complete Stage 1 of this project, which includes new roadway connections, the removal of the Ashley Drive off-ramp and flyover, the installation of new signals, new and improved active transportation facilities, and traffic calming measures. The community will also be asked to participate in the placement of public art elements. Once completed, the area will be more walkable, safer, and provide the community access to affordable housing. It will also create workforce training opportunities through a 12% apprenticeship requirement employment rate for the project.","19332":"Statewide405.1: Other Minor Flood Control","15862":"Camuy302.1: Landslide Stabilization - Structural","6595":"Amador403.1: Stormwater Management - Culverts","30321":"Martin200.1: Acquisition of Private Real Property (Structures and Land) - Riverine","33973":"Michigan State Block Grant Program: Acquire Land For Approaches","8468":"Waukesha200.1: Acquisition of Private Real Property (Structures and Land) - Riverine","22584":"Bay103.1: Feasibility, Engineering and Design Studies","36313":"Transportation Investments for Employment and Safety (TIES) Project: The proposed project involves project development, final design, and construction activities for track-related improvements and enhancements to certain grade crossings.

I-94 construction displaced or destroyed over 700 homes and 300 businesses in Rondo, initiating a long period of economic and social decline for the community.","26431":"Harrison200.1: Acquisition of Private Real Property (Structures and Land) - Riverine","30596":"Kingsbury400.1: Utility Protective Measures (Electric, Gas, etc.)","8303":"Statewide700.1: Management Costs - Salaries","6323":"Emmet600.1: Warning Systems (as a Component of a Planned, Adopted, and Exercised Risk Reduction Plan)","28046":"","29699":"Franklin403.1: Stormwater Management - Culverts","7642":"Orange205.5: Structural Retrofitting\/Rehabilitating Private Structures - Seismic","5577":"Waldo601.1: Generators","14248":"Day400.1: Utility Protective Measures (Electric, Gas, etc.)","4602":"Wichita200.1: Acquisition of Private Real Property (Structures and Land) - Riverine","30274":"Statewide700.1: Management Costs - Salaries","19547":"Meigs200.1: Acquisition of Private Real Property (Structures and Land) - Riverine","22647":"Pike601.1: Generators","26228":"Oktibbeha601.2: Generators - Regular","32437":"","6683":"Fayette601.1: Generators","33084":"Statewide904.1: Advanced Assistance","29112":"Oklahoma200.1: Acquisition of Private Real Property (Structures and Land) - Riverine","27095":"Statewide700.1: Management Costs - Salaries","21408":"","341":"Jackson200.4: Acquisition of Public Real Property (Structures and Land) - Coastal","2474":"Providence91.1: Local Multihazard Mitigation Plan","12740":"Union91.3: Local Multihazard Mitigation Plan - UPDATE","33389":"Lake202.1: Elevation of Private Structures - Riverine","24642":"Statewide700.1: Management Costs - Salaries","2444":"Jefferson91.1: Local Multihazard Mitigation Plan","37176":"Washington State Department of Transportation on behalf of 2 rural transit agencies_WA_Buses and Bus Facilities Competitive Program: The Washington State Department of Transportation will receive funding to buy transit vehicles and a bus washing system for Grays Harbor Transit Authority and the Grant Transit Authority to replace aging buses.

The Visger and Salliotte Road Highway_x0002_Railroad Grade Crossing Elimination Study will determine the feasibility of redesigning the crossing to improve conditions and restore community connectivity locally and regionally. Currently, the at-grade railroad crossings on Visger and Salliotte are poorly suited to the community because the conditions pose a safety hazard to pedestrians and automobile drivers. Visger Road is a collector street marked with space for two-way traffic and unmarked on-street parking. The street narrows at the crossing and there is no bike lane or designated pedestrian crossing. The study will help support the potential installation of grade separation at high-traffic crossings and warning systems at all crossings as well as the improvement of cyclist safety by providing alternative transportation options to communities affected by crossings. These solutions will address infrastructure barriers, reconnect the community of Ecorse and adjacent communities, and improve the quality of life for residents who have been harmed by historic practices. Improvements to these crossings that allow people to move freely in Ecorse would also connect community members to recent and ongoing investments being made to improve natural areas in Ecorse.","12239":"Indian River300.2: Vegetation Management - Wildfire","15700":"Webster601.1: Generators","25996":"St. John206.1: Safe Room (Tornado and Severe Wind Shelter) - Private Structures","30861":"Wyandotte200.1: Acquisition of Private Real Property (Structures and Land) - Riverine","18128":"Polk800.1: Miscellaneous","11103":"Mercer200.1: Acquisition of Private Real Property (Structures and Land) - Riverine","11337":"","13221":"Statewide100.1: Public Awareness and Education (Brochures, Workshops, Videos, etc.)","35891":"The Southwest Chief La Junta Route Restoration Program: The project will replace the last 34 miles of unrehabilitated track on the Southwest Chief route, including 29 miles of bolted rail with new Continuous Welded Rail (CWR) and approximately 4.8 miles of embedded CWR; approximately 15 panel turnouts; and approximately 20 panelized grade crossings.

The Downtown and West Jackson connections are critical for reconnecting underserved communities and neighborhoods that have been harmed by the central railroad dividing the city. This proposal aims to connect communities and neighborhoods that have been segregated by legacy transportation infrastructure projects like highways, arterial roadways, and the railroad line. A key objective of the proposal is to make the trail more accessible and equitable by creating a strong pedestrian and bicycle connection under the active railroad to better connect underserved West Jackson to Downtown.

Due to proximity of these urban centers, and neighboring regions urban centers, many of the regions residents and workers travel across transit operating boundaries for work and other critical destinations, such as, healthcare, education, job training centers, and recreation. The Western Connecticut Council of Governments, in partnership with the Housatonic Valley Metropolitan Planning Organization, Southwestern Region Metropolitan Planning Organization, Norwalk Transit District, CT transit Stamford Division, and Housatonic Area Regional Transit, are seeking to conduct a coordinated planning effort to identify these barriers and provide solutions to access destinations efficiently and affordably beyond each of the transit operators\u2019 boundaries. The dividing facility is identified as the network of fixed-route, demand-response and other public transportation services operated by CTtransit, HARTransit and NTD. In general, barriers to access, mobility and economic development in the region have been tied to: 1) a need for increased service frequency where transit already operates; 2) a need for door-to-door service in outlying communities (i.e. New Milford and Newtown), 3) a general desire for on-demand public transportation in subareas of the entire region, and 4) transit connections to other cities in adjacent planning regions where no or limited options currently exist (Bridgeport, Waterbury). This study aims to address the challenges faced by the regions\u2019 transit systems including lower ridership as well as fiscal and operational challenges as well as those associated with increased congestion in the regions roadways. And serve as the foundation for transit services that will add affordable transportation access through context-sensitive strategies and address existing transportation facilities that create barriers to community connectivity or negative impacts on the human or natural environment, especially in disadvantaged or underserved communities.","27700":"","37516":"Community Connections: A Regional Planning Effort: This planning project will: 1) inventory bike\/pedestrian facilities within 10 counties of the Barren River Area Development District, 2) explore the feasibility of an interconnected greenway system for the region as an alternative to motor vehicle travel, and 3) develop complete streets plans in five cities (Franklin, Scottsville, Glasgow, Russellville, and Tompkinsville).","245":"Washington402.1: Infrastructure Protective Measures (Roads and Bridges)","30491":"Suffolk205.8: Retrofitting Public Structures - Wind","25519":"Rolette400.1: Utility Protective Measures (Electric, Gas, etc.)","27257":"Hopkins602.1: Other Equipment Purchase and Installation","5190":"Statewide700.1: Management Costs - Salaries","8413":"Walla Walla304.1: (Creation of) Defensible Space (Wildfire)","37744":"Aberdeen Transit Oriented \u2013 Station Square Improvements Project: This project is a planning study to create engineering and design plans, conduct an environmental feasibility study, and establish right-of-way needs for future improvements to restore connectivity to the multi-modal transportation services for the community.

The project will develop a comprehensive plan to increase mobility and connectivity, repair the community, and redress inequities and barriers to opportunity throughout the Westside of Kansas City. Since the early 1900s, the Westside has been home to immigrants from Mexico, Central, and Latin America who created a rich and diverse neighborhood that was a mix of housing, restaurants, and businesses. However, in the late 1960s, I-35 was constructed, cutting off connections between the residents and businesses in the Westside from the Central Business District and exacerbating disinvestment.

The study would focus on an approximate three-quarter mile stretch of Geary, between Laguna and Divisadero, and the neighborhoods immediately adjacent to the corridor. This segment of Geary has an underpass at Fillmore that was constructed in 1961 as an \u201curban renewal\u201d expressway for commuters to bypass this area and quickly travel downtown. The expressway project widened Geary and decimated existing housing, displacing Black, Asian, and Jewish communities, and creating a division between the Japantown\/Fillmore neighborhoods. At the center of the study area is the intersection of Geary and Fillmore, which is a major transit node in the city that connects the 22-Fillmore with the 38-Geary\/38R-Geary Rapid, two of the busiest bus lines in San Francisco. The existing overpass has limited space to accommodate high levels of activity around this important transfer. The highway-like conditions on Geary create challenging crossings in communities with a high concentration of children, seniors, and people with disabilities. The Study would envision a high-quality multimodal transportation-oriented neighborhood that would bring connectivity and economic benefits to the Japantown\/Fillmore communities. Recommendations will include multimodal network connectivity and safety improvements, long-term transportation expansions and enhancements, development feasibility analyses for potential affordable housing sites and economic development strategies, anti-displacement strategies, and concept-level urban design guidance.","1480":"Avoyelles97.1: Expanded Mitigation Strategies - PILOT","23991":"Lee200.1: Acquisition of Private Real Property (Structures and Land) - Riverine","16924":"Story601.2: Generators - Regular","34108":"Construct\/Extend\/Improve Safety Area: Construct\/Extend\/Improve Safety Area","31038":"Suffolk404.1: Localized Flood Control System to Protect Critical Facility","24538":"Idaho93.3: Tribal Multihazard Mitigation Plan - UPDATE","16891":"Statewide700.1: Management Costs - Salaries; \n700.2: Management Costs - Equipment; \n700.3: Management Costs - Office Space Rental; \n700.4: Management Costs - Supplies","2342":"Tallapoosa206.2: Safe Room (Tornado and Severe Wind Shelter) - Public Structures","36584":"Northern Michigan Rail Planning Phase II Study and Service Development Plan: This planning project will develop a Service Development Plan to consider new train services through fifteen counties between southeast Michigan and northern lower Michigan.","20220":"","16380":"Statewide104.1: Developing, Implementing and Enforcing Codes, Standards, Ordinances and Regulations","19951":"Mobile601.1: Generators","26017":"King302.1: Landslide Stabilization - Structural","14157":"Mower602.1: Other Equipment Purchase and Installation","22346":"","4868":"Washington91.1: Local Multihazard Mitigation Plan","30322":"","14108":"Allegheny200.1: Acquisition of Private Real Property (Structures and Land) - Riverine","24411":"York91.5: Local Multijurisdictional Multihazard Mitigation Plan - UPDATE","30597":"","27396":"Plymouth403.1: Stormwater Management - Culverts","14370":"Butler91.1: Local Multihazard Mitigation Plan","35093":"Terminal (PFC only: Gates: Terminal (PFC only: Gates and Related Areas)","8133":"Kossuth91.1: Local Multihazard Mitigation Plan","24609":"Statewide700.1: Management Costs - Salaries; \n700.2: Management Costs - Equipment; \n700.3: Management Costs - Office Space Rental; \n700.4: Management Costs - Supplies","8866":"Stanley91.1: Local Multihazard Mitigation Plan","17414":"Covington206.2: Safe Room (Tornado and Severe Wind Shelter) - Public Structures","38042":"Township of Southampton Safe Streets Action Plan: This award will be used by Southampton Township to develop a comprehensive safety action plan, conduct supplemental planning activities such as speed studies and roadway safety audits, and pilot demonstration activities including MUTCD Engineering Studies for signal warrants.","24257":"Dawson91.1: Local Multihazard Mitigation Plan","27544":"Faulkner206.2: Safe Room (Tornado and Severe Wind Shelter) - Public Structures","25618":"Statewide90.6: Mitigation Plan - State Multihazard Mitigation Plan","29764":"","32394":"Cleburne206.1: Safe Room (Tornado and Severe Wind Shelter) - Private Structures","21395":"Oakland600.1: Warning Systems (as a Component of a Planned, Adopted, and Exercised Risk Reduction Plan)","3174":"Blue Earth91.1: Local Multihazard Mitigation Plan","31783":"St. Charles403.2: Stormwater Management - Diversions","26904":"Lafayette200.2: Acquisition of Private Real Property (Structures and Land) - Coastal; \n202.2: Elevation of Private Structures - Coastal","35654":"Blue Water Bridge Plaza Expansion: The Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) will be awarded $25 million to replace and expand an existing land port of entry at the U.S.-Canada border.

The project will undertake planning, design, conceptual engineering, and environmental review to reconstruct the road and intersections as a complete street through the project area. The project is expected to include dedicated transit lanes, protected bike lanes, and urban greening. Monterey Road has been an important transportation corridor for hundreds of years \u2013 in the 1700s it was part of \u201cEl Camino Real\u201d (Spanish for \u201cThe Royal Road\u201d) and later became an established stagecoach route. Ever-expanding development led to Monterey Road as it exists today: a 100\u2019 wide, six lane facility with speeds up to 50 mph, rendering walking or biking along or across the corridor unwelcoming and dangerous for the community that lives alongside it, a population of roughly 84,000, with over 20% of households defined as low-income. From 2019 to March 2022, Monterey Road was the site of 42 fatalities and severe injuries, 357 injuries, and 476 collisions. The project proposes to redesign Monterey Road as a complete street that will prioritize safety and improve accessibility for individuals who walk, bike, or use transit. Connectivity and mobility restrictions exist for both east-west and north-south travel. This is due to the limited number of crossings over Monterey Road, and as a result of no parallel city streets that run continuously through the project area. Additionally, Monterey Road runs directly adjacent to the Union Pacific Railroad line with active freight and passenger trains, and California High Speed Rail service will soon be added. The project area consists of many historically disadvantaged neighborhoods that have been disproportionately impacted and will be included in the transportation decision making process. Community engagement activities will bring residents, community organizations, and transportation agencies together to identify the most important transportation challenges and develop strategies to overcome them.

The goal is to develop a collaborative plan for the 60-acre site that considers redressing historic inequities, while coordinating land use, housing, and transportation needs that are reflective of the city\u2019s existing and future population. From the 1960s onward, targeted investments to increase freeway size, connection, and access ultimately began displacing thriving and mixed-income communities of color in Northwest Pasadena. In this case, a highway \u201cstub\u201d was built in anticipation of future highway connection, resulting in residential displacement that severed community access to an active central businesses district. The freeway connection never came, leaving an irrelevant highway \u201cstub\u201d with the surrounding residents isolated and devoid of economic opportunity. In August 2022, the \u201cstub\u201d was relinquished to the City of Pasadena.

In addition, the city has an existing climate action plan and will utilize this planning effort to continue to build upon implementing strategies for reducing the city\u2019s carbon footprint.

The pedestrian bridge will also traverse over another local road, Water Street, and connect to the State of California designated California Coast Trail on the north end, which runs along Harry Bridges Boulevard.","23954":"","34137":"Construct\/Modify\/Improve\/Rehabilitate Hangar: Construct\/Modify\/Improve\/Rehabilitate Hangar","20621":"Statewide601.1: Generators","2097":"Mendocino95.2: Planning Related Activities","17842":"Snyder202.1: Elevation of Private Structures - Riverine","34795":"Plattsburgh International Airport: FOD Detection Equipment","4595":"Broward601.2: Generators - Regular","6539":"ScottFMA Plan","13417":"Hughes400.1: Utility Protective Measures (Electric, Gas, etc.)","10569":"Statewide700.1: Management Costs - Salaries; \n700.4: Management Costs - Supplies","27293":"Miami-Dade205.8: Retrofitting Public Structures - Wind","15401":"Peach600.1: Warning Systems (as a Component of a Planned, Adopted, and Exercised Risk Reduction Plan)","18882":"Kenosha200.1: Acquisition of Private Real Property (Structures and Land) - Riverine","22958":"Boone601.1: Generators","30940":"Statewide205.8: Retrofitting Public Structures - Wind","3497":"Minnehaha200.1: Acquisition of Private Real Property (Structures and Land) - Riverine","17824":"Linn206.2: Safe Room (Tornado and Severe Wind Shelter) - Public Structures","21570":"Flathead201.1: Relocation of Private Structures - Riverine","33429":"","30708":"Perry206.2: Safe Room (Tornado and Severe Wind Shelter) - Public Structures","4877":"Orange205.6: Structural Retrofitting\/Rehabilitating Public Structures - Seismic","30057":"Scott600.1: Warning Systems (as a Component of a Planned, Adopted, and Exercised Risk Reduction Plan)","5503":"Dare100.1: Public Awareness and Education (Brochures, Workshops, Videos, etc.)","13758":"Statewide700.1: Management Costs - Salaries","36548":"PortMiami Net Zero Program: Cargo Mobility Optimization and Resiliency Project: The Project consists of two elements: (1) Expanded Intermodal Rail Capacity, and (2) Cargo Gate Optimization.

New Jersey Transit\u2019s (NJT) Long Branch Station has the 5th highest ridership of the twenty stations on the North Jersey Coast Line (NJCL), with over 1,000 average weekday boardings in 2019. Originally built in 1875, there is no access to the station from the western side where a retaining wall on the outbound platform acts as a barrier. Those seeking to access the west side of the station must exit the station and travel via Third Avenue to the north or south around the station and yard complex to reach their destination or the shops, restaurants, and medical services there. Likewise, east side residents and workers struggle to access neighborhood services and other daily destinations on the west side of the station area. This project will replace a portion of existing parking with a green station plaza that includes stairs and ADA-compliant ramps to provide access to all parts of the station. The pedestrian tunnel project will improve local connectivity, address safety challenges and inequitable access to transit, while making the station more resilient long term. The project enhances bicycle and pedestrian accommodations, with the installation of bike racks and a bus shelter, which will make transportation modes other than driving more accessible and is in line with the vision and priorities identified by the Long Branch Master Plan. Key design integrations in the project will include green spaces, illuminated art installations, and a mural and mosaic panel in the tunnel station connection that create an opportunity to celebrate local culture through visual art. Additionally, there will be a new plaza that will offer a community space to residents. A project labor agreement will ensure the creation of good-paying union jobs and workforce development initiatives focused on underrepresented groups will also be utilized.","13531":"Clarendon400.1: Utility Protective Measures (Electric, Gas, etc.); \n401.1: Water and Sanitary Sewer System Protective Measures","17500":"Watauga501.1: Other Major Structural Projects","31491":"Essex403.1: Stormwater Management - Culverts","36664":"Arthur Ashe Boulevard Bridge Replacement: This project will replace an existing multimodal bridge structure over the CSX Railroad at the City's crossroads with the eastern seaboard interstate highway corridor.","6814":"","24324":"Statewide700.1: Management Costs - Salaries","22565":"","8857":"Orange91.1: Local Multihazard Mitigation Plan","33573":"San Bernardino205.5: Structural Retrofitting\/Rehabilitating Private Structures - Seismic","38076":"Central Ohio Transportation Safety Planning and Demonstration Initiative: This award will be used by the Mid-Ohio Regional Planning Commission to update its Transportation Safety Action Plan so that it meets SS4A Action Plan requirements.

This work will include planning for and the creation of safe and convenient connectivity for residents to access health care, dining, retail, sacred, recreational, and educational amenities by implementing Complete Streets design principles. The scope of this Project will upgrade Thomas Road, a narrow two-lane roadway that was originally designed to be and function as a rural highway. Drainage for Thomas Road consists of deep roadside ditches and, along with a lack of roadside shoulders, makes it difficult for pedestrians and bicyclists to utilize. Many surrounding neighborhoods were designed for walkability with shade trees and sidewalks. However, lack of connectivity between neighborhoods and nearby amenities discourages walking and biking as viable options for short trips. These conditions create significant barriers for surrounding communities to access nearby amenities such as convenience stores, places of worship, the Baton Rouge Health Care Center, and larger retail establishments on Plank Road. These same road conditions impact usage of Baton Rouge Recreation and Parks Commissions (BREC) 390-acre Greenwood Community Park and the Baton Rouge Zoo that have entrances on Thomas Road, thus depriving residents of meaningful access to greenspace and natural areas. The Project, based on Complete Streets principles, will include a shared-use greenway path traversing the length of the Project. Curb-and-gutter drainage improvements with bioswales and green infrastructure will improve water quality and mitigate impacts of stormwater runoff.

These needs will be met through multiple infrastructure and amenity upgrades (e.g., well-marked crosswalks, signage, and waiting areas); transit (improving reliable service of existing transit operations), and operational measures (e.g. ITS, Dynamic message signs, and adaptive traffic signals) that connect to existing projects for port of entry improvements funded by FHWA and the State of Texas. The proposed Feasibility Study is needed to develop a comprehensive multimodal transportation network inclusive of walking and cycling infrastructure and public transit routes managed by Sun Metro. The Feasibility Study will implement strategies identified as part of the 2023 Downtown, Uptown, and Surrounding Neighborhoods Master Plan, including the introduction of mid-block passageways for connections to transit corridors and using signal timing and other traffic control infrastructure to prioritize pedestrian movements along Stanton Street (at congested areas from southbound port of entry traffic).

The 60 freeway at the Project location is a grade-separated facility that hinders local connectivity and is a major source of noise and air pollution for the local disadvantaged and underserved community. The construction of SR-60 (Pomona Freeway) divided the community in the 1960s, separating Belvedere Park into northern and southern halves. Today, the park functions as two separate parks. Prior to construction, the Park was the centerpiece of the community and the adjacent Civic Center. The proposed project will restore this critical community asset and create additional open space in this park-poor community. The proposed project site in East Los Angeles would primarily encompass the air space above the State Route (SR) 60 Pomona Freeway between Kern Avenue and Vancouver Avenue. The planning efforts for the freeway cap and park expansion would explore opportunities for the following potential elements: programmed recreation space, limited vehicle parking, green space or active recreation, a playground, an art element, an information kiosk with resources available to the community, a north-south paseo (including wide sidewalk areas and bicycle lanes as a major mobility connection through the park), and bicycle parking areas. Closure of a roadway network gap is included in the project plan via an extension of Kern Avenue through the Park. The existing Mednik Avenue roadway bridge over the freeway within the project footprint will be an additional connecting circulation facility through the proposed park area. The freeway cap will be provided by a bridge deck structure across the existing SR-60 freeway right of way and adjacent to both the east and west sides of the existing Mednik Avenue bridge. It is not anticipated that changes to the capacity or traffic flow of the freeway will occur after the completion of construction.","12155":"Franklin206.2: Safe Room (Tornado and Severe Wind Shelter) - Public Structures","15577":"Jackson104.1: Developing, Implementing and Enforcing Codes, Standards, Ordinances and Regulations","7633":"Le Flore600.1: Warning Systems (as a Component of a Planned, Adopted, and Exercised Risk Reduction Plan)","26808":"Montgomery601.2: Generators - Regular","27756":"Rankin600.1: Warning Systems (as a Component of a Planned, Adopted, and Exercised Risk Reduction Plan)","12131":"Coahoma403.1: Stormwater Management - Culverts; \n403.2: Stormwater Management - Diversions","22942":"Marshall601.2: Generators - Regular","12712":"Baldwin202.4: Elevation of Public Structures - Coastal","8187":"White91.1: Local Multihazard Mitigation Plan","16680":"Statewide205.8: Retrofitting Public Structures - Wind","18308":"","35736":"Bus maintenance and administrative facility improvements_WI: Bus maintenance and administrative facility improvements","16383":"Butler600.1: Warning Systems (as a Component of a Planned, Adopted, and Exercised Risk Reduction Plan)","8336":"Statewide700.1: Management Costs - Salaries","24472":"Statewide92.1: State Multihazard Mitigation Plan","31726":"Essex91.1: Local Multihazard Mitigation Plan","29657":"","4760":"Statewide100.1: Public Awareness and Education (Brochures, Workshops, Videos, etc.)","5421":"Emmet200.1: Acquisition of Private Real Property (Structures and Land) - Riverine","10490":"Putnam205.8: Retrofitting Public Structures - Wind","115":"Cass401.1: Water and Sanitary Sewer System Protective Measures","16510":"San Patricio601.1: Generators","3462":"Ware205.8: Retrofitting Public Structures - Wind","27489":"Morehouse97.1: Expanded Mitigation Strategies - PILOT","14137":"Clay600.1: Warning Systems (as a Component of a Planned, Adopted, and Exercised Risk Reduction Plan)","20723":"Pope91.1: Local Multihazard Mitigation Plan","34019":"Zanesville Municipal Airport: Rehabilitate Apron","5557":"Statewide700.4: Management Costs - Supplies","32808":"Lane402.1: Infrastructure Protective Measures (Roads and Bridges)","14033":"Statewide301.1: Shoreline Stabilization (Riprap, etc.)","5401":"Adams90.4: Mitigation Plan - Local Multihazard Mitigation Plan","17469":"Tipton206.2: Safe Room (Tornado and Severe Wind Shelter) - Public Structures","23299":"Fairfield202.2: Elevation of Private Structures - Coastal","1888":"Galveston205.8: Retrofitting Public Structures - Wind","3597":"Broward103.1: Feasibility, Engineering and Design Studies","36329":"Ties and Rail Upgrade for Economic Growth on the Keokuk Junction Railway Project: The proposed project involves project development, final design, and construction activities to complete various track-related improvements, in an effort to rehabilitate KJRY\u2019s 126-mile mainline.

The three bridges represent key connectivity features of the Citys larger transformational multimodal connectivity project, the DOT funded Pedestrian Access and Redevelopment Corridor (PARC). With continued support from DOT, the city will mitigate the transportation barriers posed by Memorial Parkway and Governors Drive which have historically isolated the Mill Creek Choice Neighborhood from safe access to economic opportunities in Downtown Huntsville. Located in the Mill Creek Choice Neighborhood, the proposed project will provide critical pedestrian and bicycle connections, allowing physically isolated residents in a low-income neighborhood and public housing developments to safely access the ever-growing number of businesses, industries, retail, employment opportunities, and services located in downtown Huntsville. The proposed project is found in census tracts 31, 21, and 12 which are identified as an area of persistent poverty and a historically disadvantaged community. According to an online survey issued by the City in 2017, 82% of respondents indicated that they would use the bridge project to walk and 47.5% would bike but noted that the reason they currently do not walk, or bike is because of the lack of trail connectivity and traffic speed. This project would mitigate inequity caused by the construction of the Memorial Parkway in 1955. Initially a four-lane highway, Memorial Parkway was viewed as the solution to the citys traffic and transportation infrastructure problem that directly aligned with the Citys urban renewal plan. However, to make way for Memorial Parkway, the Citys urban renewal plan also called for razing Black homes downtown and in Black business districts. As the homes in what is now the Mill Creek Choice Neighborhood were demolished in the late 1950s and into the 1960s, so too were Black businesses, as the City of Huntsville utilized federal \u201cslum clearance\u201d and blight mitigation funds to justify the displacement of hundreds of Black residents.","4260":"Swain700.1: Management Costs - Salaries","25354":"Yazoo601.1: Generators","6501":"Fleming200.1: Acquisition of Private Real Property (Structures and Land) - Riverine","26704":"Perkins601.1: Generators","32859":"Caroline601.1: Generators","17285":"Fond du Lac91.1: Local Multihazard Mitigation Plan","36117":"Bloomington Public Transportation Corporation_IN_Low or No Emission Grant Program: The Bloomington Public Transportation Corporation will receive funding to buy battery electric buses, install an estimated charging stations, and provide training to its workers.

Planning activities include a community participation plan, concept drawings, preliminary engineering, and environmental review. The construction of California State Route 99 ushered in a period of sharp decline for the Jane Addams Neighborhood, a disadvantaged community that found itself isolated from greenspace, community services, and economic investment following the project\u2019s completion. The isolation played a role in soon establishing Parkway Drive as the epicenter of human trafficking and crime in the Fresno community, further leading to disinvestment and community problems. Historically, the neighborhood has largely lacked curbs, sidewalks, street trees, and green space in general. Pedestrian and vehicular crossings for SR 99 are minimal and limited to high-traffic volume collectors at half-mile intervals. Crossings for SR 180 are limited to Marks Avenue, Roeding Drive, and Teilman Avenue. The limited crossings hamper vehicular, bicycle, and pedestrian connections to other parts of the city, including Roeding Park, the world-class Fresno Chaffee Zoological Gardens, and Rotary Playland and Storyland. Additionally, there are no bus stops in the neighborhood, which further limits mobility and connectivity. The project would help to correct historic wrongs by reconnecting the Jane Addams Neighborhood to park land and services and increasing business opportunities that have been lacking for decades.","15773":"Redwood400.1: Utility Protective Measures (Electric, Gas, etc.)","33400":"","11239":"Washita601.1: Generators","3680":"Volusia400.1: Utility Protective Measures (Electric, Gas, etc.)","23933":"Fairfield202.2: Elevation of Private Structures - Coastal","14129":"Lake403.1: Stormwater Management - Culverts","16119":"Bremer91.1: Local Multihazard Mitigation Plan","23900":"Statewide700.1: Management Costs - Salaries; \n700.2: Management Costs - Equipment; \n700.3: Management Costs - Office Space Rental; \n700.4: Management Costs - Supplies","1753":"Volusia202.1: Elevation of Private Structures - Riverine","24056":"Contra Costa500.1: Flood Control - Floodwall; \n500.2: Flood Control - Berm, Levee, or Dike","35789":"The New Orleans Regional Transit Authority RTA to replace a landing barge at Algiers Point and to modernize a passenger ferry_LA: The New Orleans Regional Transit Authority (RTA) will receive funding to replace a landing barge at Algiers Point and to modernize a passenger ferry.

It seeks to heal the wounds caused by divisive highway infrastructure, creating an inclusive, green community space that integrates diverse cultural art, reforestation efforts, and sustainable transportation, fostering unity and pride while addressing environmental and health concerns. The projects success is measured by increased tree canopy, cultural installations, improved air quality, and enhanced community engagement, ultimately aiming to create an equitable and vibrant space that heals past inequities and promotes community identity. Decades ago, state authorities initiated a substantial project with the aim of creating an east_x0002_west connector between Interstate 5 and Interstate 805, an endeavor with far-reaching consequences. During the 1970s, a significant portion of Southcrest was requisitioned by the state, leading to the demolition of numerous homes. Residents, facing restricted transportation choices, often resort to increased reliance on personal vehicles or endure prolonged and inconvenient commutes. This reliance, in turn, contributes to traffic congestion, air pollution, and adverse health effects, disproportionately affecting vulnerable populations such as children, the elderly, and individuals with preexisting health conditions. Additionally, the lack of accessible transportation options has led to social isolation, educational constraints, and exacerbated environmental justice concerns within the community. Residents presented the importance of creating a greenspace with pathways connecting it to San Diego, areas of National City and an envisioned community garden on the east side of that freeway. Thus, the concept of the green corridor was born.

With support from the USDOT, the City and its partners will complete the Phase 1 design and construction work for a highway cap to reconnect Chinatown, a community that is disproportionately impacted by the Vine Street Expressway (I-676). The proposed project aims to address historic inequities caused by transportation infrastructure, restore community connectivity, and improve quality of life. Since its inception in the 1960s, the Vine Street Expressway has represented a threat to the Chinatown community. Upon completion in the 1990s, the highway effectively separated the neighborhood into the commercial core of Chinatown to the south and a more industrial area to the North. As people learned to navigate around this significant barrier in the heart of the community, many groups and organizations devised plans to help mitigate the impacts of the expressway. As early as 2004, the Philadelphia Chinatown Development Corporation (PCDC) and Asian Americans United initiated the Chinatown Neighborhood Plan. The plan recommended a \u201cVine Street Cover Park\u201d to bring green space to the community. Addressing this recommendation is essential, for Chinatown is the only defined Philadelphia neighborhood without a dedicated green space or park.","13503":"Forrest200.1: Acquisition of Private Real Property (Structures and Land) - Riverine","23098":"","15637":"SomersetFMA Plan","24139":"Fulton403.4: Stormwater Management - Detention\/Retention Basins","19842":"Macomb600.1: Warning Systems (as a Component of a Planned, Adopted, and Exercised Risk Reduction Plan)","8309":"Cedar600.1: Warning Systems (as a Component of a Planned, Adopted, and Exercised Risk Reduction Plan)","21045":"Tallahatchie600.1: Warning Systems (as a Component of a Planned, Adopted, and Exercised Risk Reduction Plan)","30075":"Lafayette200.1: Acquisition of Private Real Property (Structures and Land) - Riverine; \n202.1: Elevation of Private Structures - Riverine","19996":"Lackawanna904.1: Advanced Assistance","20787":"Summit91.5: Local Multijurisdictional Multihazard Mitigation Plan - UPDATE","154":"Hancock91.1: Local Multihazard Mitigation Plan","21529":"Webster200.1: Acquisition of Private Real Property (Structures and Land) - Riverine","35912":"Broadway (Route 15) Roadway and Intersection Improvements: This project realigns the northbound and southbound I-95 on and off ramps (Exit 185) with Broadway (Route 15) and upgrades traffic signal equipment at each intersection.

The tollway cuts off access to multi-modal transportation options available in other parts of the county forcing residents to rely on primarily automobile transportation to access jobs another other important businesses and services. The Harris County Toll Road Authority (HCTRA) is undertaking an effort to redesign the Westpark Tollway, focusing on adding multimodal infrastructure, public space, and connectivity to major employment centers and METROs University Bus Rapid Transit corridor. Reconnect Alief is an opportunity to build on this transformative infrastructure investment. This planning effort will include tasks to create a list of recommended projects \u2013 bicycle-pedestrian, transit, parks and open spaces, and roadway safety. The planning project will focus on safe accommodation for all users and seamless integration with the surrounding character, context, and land use, considering climate resilience, stormwater, flood risk management, public health, and the economy.

Interstate 15 (I-15) creates a barrier that separates low-income and disadvantaged communities on the west side of the freeway from social and cultural resources such as parks, schools, grocery stores, medical facilities, and jobs on the east side of the freeway. The lack of permeability across major roads creates a vehicle dependency that is often disproportionately borne by marginalized communities. The two existing crossing options in this area are a full freeway interchange at Bluff Street or an underpass at 700 South. Both facilities have annual average daily traffic (AADT) counts above 25,000 and no bike infrastructure. High AADT counts and a lack of bike infrastructure create a dangerous, high-stress environment for non-motorized users. The City of St. George 400 East and 900 South Interstate Crossings Project (the Project) will address these burdens and past harms by constructing two new underpasses: one at 400 East and one at 900 South. The proposed design includes dedicated active transportation infrastructure, which will help decrease transportation-sector greenhouse gas emissions by improving multimodal access, mobility, and safety. These improved connections will also help reduce vehicle miles traveled by providing a local option for shorter neighborhood trips. The Project will directly meet Justice40 requirements by connecting two Historically Disadvantaged census tracts and an Area of Persistent Poverty with expanded community resources and more equitable and affordable transportation choices. The project will coincide with a highway widening project for I-15, and will greatly mitigate the potential negative impacts of such a widening.","29118":"Windham402.1: Infrastructure Protective Measures (Roads and Bridges); \n403.2: Stormwater Management - Diversions","33266":"Hamilton200.1: Acquisition of Private Real Property (Structures and Land) - Riverine","15778":"Tompkins601.1: Generators","29871":"","1283":"Franklin103.1: Feasibility, Engineering and Design Studies","24676":"Lucas200.1: Acquisition of Private Real Property (Structures and Land) - Riverine","33797":"Beckham601.1: Generators","7229":"Wharton103.1: Feasibility, Engineering and Design Studies; \n405.1: Other Minor Flood Control","1820":"Statewide700.1: Management Costs - Salaries","18298":"Walker206.2: Safe Room (Tornado and Severe Wind Shelter) - Public Structures","26565":"Belknap601.1: Generators","34826":"Improve: Improve\/Modify\/Rehabilitate Service Road,Rehabilitate Apron,Rehabilitate Taxilane,Rehabilitate Taxiway","20316":"Prince William600.1: Warning Systems (as a Component of a Planned, Adopted, and Exercised Risk Reduction Plan)","31104":"Travis200.1: Acquisition of Private Real Property (Structures and Land) - Riverine","30158":"Burnet200.1: Acquisition of Private Real Property (Structures and Land) - Riverine","13777":"","7279":"Jasper91.1: Local Multihazard Mitigation Plan","6191":"","35014":"Improve\/Modify\/Rehabilitate Terminal Building: Improve\/Modify\/Rehabilitate Terminal Building","9098":"Los Angeles205.4: Non Structural Retrofitting\/Rehabilitating Public Structures - Seismic","23794":"Douglas301.1: Shoreline Stabilization (Riprap, etc.); \n402.1: Infrastructure Protective Measures (Roads and Bridges)","18373":"Forest91.1: Local Multihazard Mitigation Plan","11778":"Hennepin206.2: Safe Room (Tornado and Severe Wind Shelter) - Public Structures","38080":"Developing a Miami Valley Toward Zero Action Plan: This award will be used by the Miami Valley Regional Planning Commission to develop a comprehensive safety action plan.","34516":"Install Perimeter Fencing not: Install Perimeter Fencing not Required by 49 CFR 1542","5591":"Statewide95.2: Planning Related Activities","31306":"Clermont200.1: Acquisition of Private Real Property (Structures and Land) - Riverine","10904":"Geneva206.1: Safe Room (Tornado and Severe Wind Shelter) - Private Structures","13632":"San Juan205.8: Retrofitting Public Structures - Wind","4562":"Tarrant200.1: Acquisition of Private Real Property (Structures and Land) - Riverine","1140":"Skagit200.1: Acquisition of Private Real Property (Structures and Land) - Riverine","14249":"Forrest206.2: Safe Room (Tornado and Severe Wind Shelter) - Public Structures","35817":"The Asacarsarmiut Tribe to continue operations and to purchase vehicles_AK: The Asa'carsarmiut Tribe will receive funding to continue operations and to purchase vehicles.

The project addresses transportation inequities by providing safe walking, bicycling, and rolling facilities that do not exist today and by improving crossings of dividing facilities like Highway 20 and the railroad. The project provides accessible active transportation infrastructure along with streetscape improvements that provide resilient infrastructure. This will spur new economic development and community wealth to build a thriving Old Town community. Old Town Decatur was once a thriving African American community, with mixed-use development and various family-owned businesses. Urban renewal and decades of disinvestment devastated the community. Today, half the neighborhood is vacant, and the community sees high rates of poverty. 92% of the project corridor is located within disadvantaged communities, and the area is in the 90th percentile for projected flood risk and expected population loss. The communities have high rates of asthma, diabetes, heart disease, and other health issues. Old Town does not have access to grocery stores; residents must cross Highway 20 to reach these amenities. The trail will provide connections to parks and commercial redevelopment along the Tennessee River, as well as schools, jobs, community services, and places of worship. The project will improve safe access to important resources, including separate walking and biking facilities and safer intersections. Old Town residents do not have access to public transportation; there is no bus service.","1808":"Ventura600.1: Warning Systems (as a Component of a Planned, Adopted, and Exercised Risk Reduction Plan)","13187":"","35977":"Nunakauyak Traditional Council Signage Project Traffic Safety Signs and Sign Inventory_AK: Nunakauyak Traditional Council Signage Project: Traffic Safety Signs and Sign Inventory","3426":"Clarke600.1: Warning Systems (as a Component of a Planned, Adopted, and Exercised Risk Reduction Plan)","38038":"Township of Cherry Hill Safe Streets Action Plan: This award will be used by Cherry Hill Township to develop a comprehensive safety action plan, conduct supplemental planning activities such as speed studies and roadway safety audits, and pilot demonstration activities including MUTCD Engineering Studies for signal warrants.","2515":"Statewide700.1: Management Costs - Salaries; \n700.2: Management Costs - Equipment; \n700.3: Management Costs - Office Space Rental; \n700.4: Management Costs - Supplies","34634":"Install Runway Lighting,Install Runway Vertical: Install Runway Lighting,Install Runway Vertical\/Visual Guidance System,Install Taxiway Lighting","14832":"Polk200.1: Acquisition of Private Real Property (Structures and Land) - Riverine","6792":"Washington91.4: Local Multijurisdictional Multihazard Mitigation Plan - NEW ","35545":"Hospitality on Peninsula HOP Park Ride Lot and Multimodal Transit Hub_SC: Hospitality on Peninsula (HOP) Park & Ride Lot and Multimodal Transit Hub","33849":"Hunterdon601.2: Generators - Regular","32312":"Tillamook904.2: Advance Assistance (FMA and PDMC)","31739":"Livingston91.1: Local Multihazard Mitigation Plan","25282":"Harris200.1: Acquisition of Private Real Property (Structures and Land) - Riverine","36124":"Biddeford-Saco-Old Orchard Beach Transit Committee_ME_Low or No Emission Grant Program: The Biddeford-Saco-Old Orchard Beach Transit Committee will receive funding to buy battery electric buses to replace diesel buses.

The advisory committee engaged 80+ residents, the Knowledge Park leadership group, property owners and developers, nearby Winthrop University, local businesses, and the African American Business District in the planning process and released a connectivity study in March 2018. This study identified the current connectivity barriers, outlined feedback from stakeholders, and recommended a course of action \u2013 construction of a pedestrian\/cyclist bridge over Dave Lyle Boulevard and the parallel railroad tracks.

Removing the exit ramps will reconnect the once historic grid street network with new connections and provide access for neighboring communities to downtown, the Canal District and the new arena. It will create small sized neighborhood blocks, providing a safer pedestrian friendly environment by reducing vehicular speeds and adding public green spaces for the community. Removal of the I-16 interchange ramps is intended to spur neighborhood revitalization and equitable redevelopment opportunities over the reclaimed eight acres of land in downtown Savannah, for affordable housing, businesses, civic spaces and other community needs as identified through the public engagement process. Although the I-16 interchange was constructed as an urban renewal program, the residential and business displacement and subsequent ramp construction caused historic injustices to Frogtown and Currietown, a Jewish neighborhood established in the 1830s, and have remained a barrier to development and economic vitality. This has become a physical and psychological barrier to economic development, pedestrian activity, and neighborhood revitalization. The area to the north and east of the site has been able to develop and thrive, while the area to the south and west has languished. The removal of this barrier would rectify decades of harm.","9395":"Hamilton200.1: Acquisition of Private Real Property (Structures and Land) - Riverine","29605":"Oklahoma601.1: Generators","26628":"Garrett601.2: Generators - Regular","24910":"Whitman91.1: Local Multihazard Mitigation Plan","7684":"","35985":"Transportation Safety Plan Update_AK: Transportation Safety Plan Update","30627":"San Bernardino91.3: Local Multihazard Mitigation Plan - UPDATE","20271":"Montgomery200.1: Acquisition of Private Real Property (Structures and Land) - Riverine; \n202.1: Elevation of Private Structures - Riverine","5586":"Delaware601.1: Generators","956":"Lee206.1: Safe Room (Tornado and Severe Wind Shelter) - Private Structures","19259":"Lackawanna200.1: Acquisition of Private Real Property (Structures and Land) - Riverine","16320":"Pasco202.1: Elevation of Private Structures - Riverine","6777":"Collier205.8: Retrofitting Public Structures - Wind","26909":"Statewide200.2: Acquisition of Private Real Property (Structures and Land) - Coastal","4998":"Page200.3: Acquisition of Public Real Property (Structures and Land) - Riverine","25820":"Ogemaw402.1: Infrastructure Protective Measures (Roads and Bridges); \n403.1: Stormwater Management - Culverts","8763":"Saunders91.1: Local Multihazard Mitigation Plan","26817":"Riley403.4: Stormwater Management - Detention\/Retention Basins","20225":"Edgar91.1: Local Multihazard Mitigation Plan","8148":"Fleming403.1: Stormwater Management - Culverts","18682":"Macomb601.1: Generators","29472":"Madera403.1: Stormwater Management - Culverts","13054":"Suwannee601.2: Generators - Regular","15007":"Leavenworth103.1: Feasibility, Engineering and Design Studies","26903":"San Diego303.2: Floodplain and Stream Restoration","17613":"Polk601.1: Generators","14618":"Seminole200.1: Acquisition of Private Real Property (Structures and Land) - Riverine","10574":"Boise700.1: Management Costs - Salaries","37610":"Puget Sound to Pacific Planning for Multi-Use Trail: This project will plan and design approximately 34 active transportation components, addressing approximately 100 miles of gaps, community connections and safety improvements for multi-use trails connecting Bainbridge Island on Puget Sound to the Pacific Coast Ocean at La Push.","19835":"Oakland103.1: Feasibility, Engineering and Design Studies","33795":"Escambia405.1: Other Minor Flood Control","1035":"Weld403.1: Stormwater Management - Culverts; \n405.1: Other Minor Flood Control","4035":"Jackson206.2: Safe Room (Tornado and Severe Wind Shelter) - Public Structures","16863":"Tuscaloosa206.2: Safe Room (Tornado and Severe Wind Shelter) - Public Structures","1191":"Middlesex200.1: Acquisition of Private Real Property (Structures and Land) - Riverine","4111":"Gordon91.3: Local Multihazard Mitigation Plan - UPDATE","33088":"Georgetown403.1: Stormwater Management - Culverts; \n403.2: Stormwater Management - Diversions; \n403.5: Floodwater Storage and Diversion","9879":"Statewide100.1: Public Awareness and Education (Brochures, Workshops, Videos, etc.)","20123":"St. Tammany97.1: Expanded Mitigation Strategies - PILOT","30712":"Lake200.1: Acquisition of Private Real Property (Structures and Land) - Riverine","25969":"Statewide600.1: Warning Systems (as a Component of a Planned, Adopted, and Exercised Risk Reduction Plan)","10601":"","33632":"Sacramento91.2: Local Multihazard Mitigation Plan - NEW","33576":"Glades103.1: Feasibility, Engineering and Design Studies; \n402.1: Infrastructure Protective Measures (Roads and Bridges); \n403.2: Stormwater Management - Diversions","10749":"Baldwin601.1: Generators","32115":"","24533":"Umatilla200.1: Acquisition of Private Real Property (Structures and Land) - Riverine"}}
