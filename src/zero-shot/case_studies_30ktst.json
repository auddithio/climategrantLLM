The goal of the planning project is to engage the affected communities in a design process with the assistance of a team of professionals to develop innovative strategies to reconnect these neighborhoods through the enhancement of twelve crossing points. Through the proposed planning process, CRA will hire a team of transportation planners, engineers, landscape architects, and local artists to assist these communities in redefining North Memphiss relationship with I-40 and develop actionable solutions that provide a safe, vibrant experience for residents and their vision for their community. The current state of pedestrian, bike, and ADA connections over and under I-40 is unsafe, uninviting and\/or non_x0002_existent to the point of preventing access across the interstate without use of a car. Simply put, these facilities, intended to provide public access, contribute to the blight in the communities where they are located, without providing any benefit of access. Because of the egregious conditions of the intersections and their significant neighborhood impacts, community-driven planning has been conducted over the last 5-10 years, and this planning grant builds on that foundation, with a focus on working out the design details and to prepare as much as possible for implementation. Important elements for consideration will include improving pedestrian and bike infrastructure, reimagining perilous pedestrian bridges, and exploring measures to turn adjacent vacant lots into a network of environmentally beneficial green spaces with trails.","11047":"Neighborhood Revitalization through Retrofit of Highway 63B in Americas Fastest Shrinking City: Pine Bluff, Arkansas: The project team seeks to perform a planning study for the context-sensitive retrofit of Arkansas State Highway 63B. This five-lane principal arterial is burdened by disinvestment in commercial development\u2014now mostly large abandoned dead zones. Desertification throughout the oversized corridor has accelerated economic decline in this African American neighborhood. Its blighted environment has eroded residents\u2019 livability, health, and safety in an otherwise intact early-twentieth century streetcar neighborhood with a walkable street network and diverse housing fabric. Hwy 63B exhibits poor traffic access management with expansive curb cuts and unlimited left hand turn areas that create multiple conflict points resulting in accidents. Sidewalk facilities are discontinuous, in severe disrepair, and lack adequate buffers to travel lanes. Property vacancies and the resulting environmental blight, coupled with nominal traffic counts (14,000 vehicles\/day) on the highways oversized capacity, promote high traffic speeds, which accelerates decline in this unsafe environment. Spillover effects are reflected in the bottoming of residential property values in this South-Central neighborhood. Scenario planning will explore options in right-sizing a 1.2-mile segment of this low-trafficked corridor as an active transportation network spine with urban infill land-use improvements between the downtown business district and the Citys largest employment center to the south, the Jefferson Regional Medical Center. Additionally, strategies to align climate adaptation with equitable outcomes will employ green urbanism, resilient infrastructure, and value recapture tools to create a livable, peopled corridor, well aligned with Arkansas DOTs forthcoming Carbon Reduction Plan.","11048":"Community-Led Reconnection of the Westside Neighborhood: The project will conduct feasibility and design studies for implementation of the transportation recommendations in the recently adopted Westside Evolves Plan. Throughout the Westside Evolves planning process, participants indicated how US-27 and Riverfront Parkway together contribute to the neighborhoods isolation and residents\u2019 feelings of separation from the broader urban fabric of Chattanooga. The plans recommendations include two crucial new street connections as well as broad, site-wide complete streets improvements that will reconnect the disadvantaged neighborhood to economic, recreational, and social opportunities in Downtown Chattanooga and the Riverfront district. To ensure the redevelopment process for the Westside is grounded in an equity lens, a community advisory group of Westside residents came together with a coalition of community partners in 2020 to launch a participatory process called Westside Community Evolves. The planning team worked hand-in-hand with community residents to create a vision for the future of the neighborhood, both in terms of demolition and replacement of existing deeply affordable housing stock and integration of new housing at different income levels mixed into the community, with emphasis on an anti-displacement, build-first strategy. The culmination of this process, the final Westside Evolves Plan adopted by the Chattanooga City Council, lays out an ambitious 10+-year roadmap for equitable, sustainable, and holistic revitalization of the community, including transportation infrastructure that reduces barriers from existing infrastructure and reconnects the Westside to surrounding opportunities. This planning grant will take the Plans conceptual visions for a new transportation network in the Westside to the next step toward implementation. Specifically, it will fund feasibility studies and preliminary design work necessary for several transformational infrastructure projects, with a particular focus on work needed to extend West 12th Street and Grove Street. These projects will mitigate the impacts of US-27 and Riverfront Parkway as significant barriers by rebuilding connections that were erased during the construction of these two high-speed facilities, upgrading safety features of existing connections, and expanding the pedestrian network internal to the community in order to allow for safe, multimodal travel between destinations.","11049":"Tacoma, WA I-5 Crossings Study: The Tacoma, WA I-5 Crossings Study will identify improvements necessary for people of all ages and abilities to safely travel across I-5, along with opportunities for placemaking and to increase the tree canopy.

This project will also develop documentation needed to be competitive for future grant funding, which may include evaluative activities to meaningfully document and measure the effectiveness of the proposed strategies. Along with solutions to address multimodal connectivity, the Study will also provide recommendations on opportunities for placemaking and to increase the tree canopy. The Study recommendations will be prioritized using a weighted score that includes equity, community input, and technical analysis. This Study will develop community-supported solutions and conceptual designs that, when implemented, will address the significant safety and accessibility challenges created by I-5 for people walking, biking, and rolling, helping to improve community connectivity and support housing and economic justice.","11050":"Multimodal Improvements on South Laburnum Avenue Over I-64: I-64 is a multi-lane interstate highway that cuts through Henrico County surrounding Richmond, Virginia. Laburnum Avenue offers some ability to cross I-64, but there is a lack of pedestrian or bicycle infrastructure; therefore, it is a safety concern. The southern side of I-64 has desirable destinations such as Richmond International Airport and White Oak Village (a shopping center with multiple businesses). This project will provide sidewalks where there are none today, improve bicycle and pedestrian crossings of the I-64 ramps, and improve transit access in the vicinity. By improving pedestrian, bicycle, and interchange infrastructure on Laburnum Avenue, communities on both the north and south sides of I-64 will be able to reach desirable destinations without the need of a personal vehicle. It will mitigate safety concerns while allowing residents to connect to both sides of I-64. It will increase the viability of businesses and housing along S. Laburnum Avenue. With businesses such as those in the White Oak Village shopping district, investors will be able to increase foot traffic to their locations and can count on residents bringing their money to these businesses. White Oak Village is an outdoor mall with several types of businesses such as clothing retail, fast food, seated restaurants, technology focused, and banking. This project will provide more active transportation connections to these businesses which will help employees and visitors to the White Oak shopping area who may not have access to a personal vehicle.

The proposal is to build a new entrance into the park with an at-grade pedestrian crossing of the train tracks and an adjacent parking lot. The park is located on a former brownfields site. A rail line has extended the full length of Susquehanna since the 1860s, parallel to the Susquehanna River nearby. The rail line was built to carry passengers and freight, and to bring supplies to and from a bustling engine-building facility for the Erie Railroad during the last half of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th. When the railroad finally closed manufacturing operations in 1960, the company left behind land polluted with mercury, arsenic, copper, lead and antimony, a struggling local economy, and a community blocked from the park and the river by an active rail line now used by Central New York Railroad. In 2017, the PA Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) and the PA Department of Conservation and Natural Resources (DCNR) awarded Susquehanna Depot a $2.5 million grant to create a public park near the center of town by reclaiming some of the contaminated land on the site of the old rail manufacturing facility. The 14.77-acre Ira Reynolds Riverfront Park became the first-ever \u201cbrownfields to greenfields\u201d demonstration project sponsored by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. This park opened to the public in 2021. Bounded by the Susquehanna River on one side and active railroad tracks on the other, at this time there is no safe or convenient way to access the park, particularly for pedestrians. Susquehanna hopes to create a new entrance to the park at a currently vacant location that is convenient to both the park and the commercial center of town.","11055":"I-90 Allston Multimodal Project: The I-90 Allston Multimodal Project \u2013 a partnership of the Massachusetts Department of Transportation (MassDOT) and the City of Boston \u2013 is a powerful opportunity to transform and modernize a deficient stretch of critical Interstate highway, open up land for new residential, institutional and commercial growth, support several neighborhoods with greatly improved transit, walking and biking infrastructure, and create new and improved access to expanded waterfront parks and open space in an Environmental Justice (EJ) community, Bostons Allston neighborhood. Today, there is overwhelming support for this project which removes approximately 2,900 feet of elevated bridge structure that has acted as barrier to multiple neighborhoods. MassDOT and the City, along with third-party contributors have committed $1.22 billion to this initiative and are requesting $500 million under the USDOT Reconnecting Communities and Neighborhoods Grant Program and have requested $200M of National Infrastructure Project Assistance (Mega) to fund the Project. The I-90 Allston Multimodal Project seeks to remedy these injustices by reconnecting communities with new Complete Streets through the interchange and railyard areas, a new multimodal transit station, more than 10 miles of new sidewalks and bike trails to serve highly desired pedestrian\/ bicycle connections to the Charles River, Boston University, and Downtown Boston, and returning more than 40 acres of land for community development, new parks and open spaces including a buffer park along the southern extent of the Project. Soldiers Field Road (SFR) will be realigned further from the banks of the Charles River to make room for a new 3.6-acre park within the historic Charles River Reservation (CRR) and much needed improvements to the heavily used Paul Dudley White (PDW) Path, expanding access to open space and recreational opportunities for residents in proximate communities.","11056":"Connecting New Orleans East for Pedestrian and Bicyclist Safety and Mobility: The City of New Orleans proposes Connecting New Orleans East for Pedestrian and Bicyclist Safety and Mobility to connect people in historically disadvantaged communities and destinations along and across the Interstate 10 (I-10). The Project will create safer connections for people walking and rolling and bicycling, connecting residential communities with commercial retail, job opportunities, and community amenities on both the north and south sides of I-10 in New Orleans East. The Project consists of a 10-foot shared-use trail, which would run along the outside edge of the service roads on both the north and south sides for the entire length of the corridor with additional connections to existing facilities on Dwyer Rd at the western end. This plan also includes ADA ramps and crosswalks at all intersections, as well as pedestrian crossing signals at the major intersections of Crowder Blvd and Bullard Ave. Appropriate lighting to accommodate pedestrians has been included in the conceptual plan. Trees and landscaping have been included to make the corridor visually appealing and comfortable, providing shade for people walking and bicycling and visual friction for drivers. Connecting the shared-use trails between the interchanges, three non-motorized bridges crossing the Interstate are included at Mayo Rd, Bundy Rd, and Wright Rd to accommodate connectivity between the north and south sides of the Interstate. Collectively, the trails on both sides of the corridor, and the crossings at the existing interchanges and new bridges will introduce a network of connectivity for walking, bicycling, and transit and fill a major mobility gap in the middle of the community.","11057":"Pleasant Hill Reconnection and Commercial Planning: Once a prominent Black community founded by formerly enslaved people, Pleasant Hill was decimated by the construction of I-75 through Macon, Georgia. In 2015, a mitigation component of a highway-widening plan gave the community funds for school and home construction, but the promised bike and pedestrian bridge into downtown Macon failed to materialize. The city and county are requesting funds for a planning study to reconnect this historic community. The historic Pleasant Hill neighborhood is seeking assistance in developing a full streetscapes and commercial development plan to reconnect the community to itself and Macons downtown business district. The plan would focus on engagement, public infrastructure, zoning changes, and anti-displacement strategies. Macon-Bibb County became a consolidated government in 2014 to correct at a high level the disparity between neighborhoods within the inner city of Macon and the formerly unincorporated areas of Bibb County. At the same time, an effort was hatched to bring reinvestment to the urban core of Macon, the historic downtown and the citys first neighborhoods. The Macon Action Plan was unveiled in 2015, but it did not include the Pleasant Hill neighborhood just beyond I-75. Because of this the plan perpetuated a history of disconnection in the neighborhood that began when the highway cut the historic black community in half. This planning project would rectify this exclusion of the Pleasant Hill neighborhood.","11058":"Ruby Road Bridge over Potrero Creek and Union Pacific Railroad: The Ruby Road project, located in rural Santa Cruz County, is in an area of persistent poverty, is within a Historically Disadvantaged Community, and has multiple physical barriers that impact connectivity. The project is located in the southern part of unincorporated Rio Rico, a census designated place. Rio Rico is the fastest growing community in Santa Cruz County. The new bridge would be the only bridge in Santa Cruz County that would span both the floodplain and the Union Pacific Railroad (UPRR), providing a resilient and reliable east-west connection for all traveling public, including bicyclists, pedestrians, emergency services, businesses, tourists, and underserved residents. In addition, the County has begun to identify funding opportunities for transit to serve this area and Ruby Road would be a key transit hub. Ruby Road is a vital connection between emergency services (Rio Rico Fire District), mining, and residential areas east of the UPRR and a key Interstate 19 (I-19) access to business and industrial areas west of the UPRR. Ruby Road also provides primary access to tourist areas such as Coronado National Forest (Nogales and Sierra Vista Ranger Districts), Patagonia Lake State Park, the Town of Patagonia, and the Wine Country of Sonoita and Elgin. The existing bridge structure, constructed almost 50 years ago (1979) to local street standards, is nearing the end of its design service life and needs significant scour maintenance annually by Santa Cruz County. The aging infrastructure, at-grade crossing of the UPRR, lack of bike lanes, and sidewalks present multiple hazards and barriers to multi-modal connectivity and social equity. This project will rectify these issues.","11059":"Downtown Waterloo Railyard Relocation and Railroad Crossing Improvement Study: The Downtown Waterloo Railyard Relocation and Railroad Crossing Improvement Study will investigate safety improvements to the railroad bisecting Waterloo, Iowa, and the possible relocation of an active railroad yard from the citys downtown to the outskirts of town. Relocating the train building yard will ease traffic issues through downtown and increase pedestrian access, while safety improvements will make the entire corridor safer. The current railyard creates numerous environmental burdens on this disadvantaged community. The railyard is a major source of air pollution. The area is in the top percentile in the state for asthma, persons with disabilities, people of color, low income, unemployment rate, and low life expectancy. Blocked rail crossings in the corridor prevent students from getting to school. The planning study would address the noise and air pollution, safety concerns, and the aesthetics of industrial facilities. Waterloo, Iowas black population has a long history of social inequity, made evident after the community was named the worst city for Black Americans in 2018. This history of segregation and injustice endures, necessitating collective action to address historical disparities. The Downtown Waterloo Railyard Relocation and Railroad Crossing Improvement Study offers a chance for transformative change. Moving the railyard closer to Waterloos Northeast Industrial Area can improve safety, connectivity, equity, and economic development for residents.","11060":"Reconnecting Georgetown: Reconnecting Georgetown proposes pedestrian safety improvements at eight intersections that cross a rail line owned by Norfolk Southern Railroad Company. The rail line divides the majority_x0002_Hispanic neighborhood of Kimmeytown and the historically-Black neighborhood of Harlemtown from downtown Georgetown, where the majority businesses, services, and cultural activities are located. The eight crossings identified by the town are non-ADA compliant, and lack crosswalks, sidewalks, proper safety signage and markings. Two crashes in these intersection in 2018 lead to four people killed or severely injured. Norfolk Southern currently prioritizes the closure of at-grade crossings, when possible. However, multi-modal access of the communities of Kimmeytown and Harlemtown is necessary given the lack of resources available in them. The Town of Georgetown proposes addressing this barrier by engaging in a community_x0002_centered process by identifying pedestrian community priorities through engagement and outreach in partnership with community organizations, initiate a feasibility study to determine intersection priority, develop project concepts and alternatives to present to the community, and determine final project design in accordance to Norfolk Southern crossing guidelines.","11061":"Reconciliation, Regeneration and Reconnecting the Selma to Montgomery Trail Through Transportation Equity Infrastructure: This project will reconnect the West Montgomery residents located on the Selma-to_x0002_Montgomery Trail to opportunities, access, and connectivity by addressing poor social determinants of health that exist because of segregation, redlining, and construction of Interstates 65 and 85. The project will enhance public open spaces, increase safety and access to public safety amenities, broadband connectivity, zero-emission transportation options, workforce transportation micro-transit, wayfinding enhancements, and investments in future redevelopment. These enhancements will allow the City of Montgomery to reinvest in foundational transportation solutions in Historic West Montgomery to facilitate the renaissance of the Selma-to-Montgomery Trail community. The project identifies many disenfranchised local communities that will benefit by enhancements to the trail. The project will also include a redevelopment of a local brownfield site into a charging station and microgrid. The project will provide West Montgomery with workforce micro-transit that will allow the residents to have access to transportation to work in one of the three large industrial parks in Montgomery. The development of the trailhead will also provide an additional low emissions transportation option that will be ADA-compliant, ensuring accessibility for all. The repaving and stripping project will also implement bike lanes. These bike lanes will ensure safety and mobility equity. Bike lanes will also ensure that bicycles implemented in Downtown Montgomery can become accessible to those in West Montgomery.","11062":"Removing the Highway Barrier: Equitably Restoring Colfax and Federal Mobility and Land Use (\"The Project\"): The Project will complete critical planning, design, and public outreach work to remove a cloverleaf interchange barrier, reconnect neighborhoods, and reimagine land use opportunities that reflect community needs and desires. The Project deliverables include preliminary engineering, completion of NEPA process, and achieving 10% design. Two miles west of downtown Denver, a cloverleaf interchange connects two major arterials \u2013 W Colfax Avenue and Federal Boulevard. However, the loop configuration prioritizes the efficient movement of vehicles while sacrificing the safe movement of people. A daunting physical barrier for pedestrians, cyclists, micro-mobility users, public transit riders, and non_x0002_vehicular travelers, the interchange disconnects and isolates disadvantaged communities from essential daily resources including education, healthcare, employment, restaurants and grocery stores, green spaces, community organizations, a city library, and other vital destinations. Additionally, the interchange burdens surrounding communities with pollution, noise, and visual impact issues caused by higher vehicular speeds. By severely limiting mobility options, the outdated interchange design forces vulnerable travelers to choose between safety and access. The reconfigured intersection will better connect residents to employment and economic opportunity, support the reduction of particulate matter exposure and traffic proximity and volume, and lead to improved health outcomes by encouraging active transportation through upgraded infrastructure for transit, pedestrians, and bicyclists. The project will implement green infrastructure in the project area and facilitate connections to the South Platte River Trail. Converting this interchange will redress past harm, remove barriers for the community, and benefit nearby communities, and all of Denver, for generations to come.","11063":"Reconnecting 4th Ave N: A Two-Way Vision for Reviving Legacy and Inspiring Progress: The 4th Ave N project is a 15-block Complete Streets redesign of Birminghams Black Main Street. The redesign will include converting the road from one-way to two-way and will help reconnect downtown neighborhoods and businesses divided by the construction of Interstate 65 in the 1960s. The project encompasses the Historic 4th Avenue Business District, a once thriving hub of black businesses and community in Birmingham. This multimodal project will revert 4th Ave N to its original two-way traffic configuration between 24th St N and 9th St N\u2014reviving the access and connectivity that helped the community thrive prior to its conversion into a one-way street during the 1970s. Project design will incorporate transit, on-street parking, bicycle facilities, streetscape elements such as benches and planters, and ADA-compliant sidewalks and intersections.","11064":"Mend the Gap: Reuniting Barrio Logan through Freeway Lid Parks: For this project, SANDAG will study the feasibility of a freeway lid at the two locations sited in the Barrio Logan Community Plan to prepare for future implementation of one or both lids. The project will develop alternatives that take into consideration multimodal connections, amenities, costs, and maintenance. This project is intended to build on previous community-led efforts and further the momentum towards the eventual realization of the communitys vision. By reclaiming the valuable real estate above the existing freeway, these lids can reunite these historically intertwined communities and begin to repair the damage that I-5, the I-5\/SR 75 interchange, and the Coronado Bridge have caused in these communities. Interstate 5 bisects the Barrio Logan and Logan Heights communities, and the I-5\/SR 75 interchange and Coronado Bridge further dissects Barrio Logan on the west side of I-5. There are few roads that cross I-5 to connect Barrio Logan and Logan Heights, so auto and pedestrian traffic is forced to funnel through the few cross-freeway connectors. The relative scarcity of these connections coupled with freeway on- and off-ramps at key crossing points create a hostile landscape for people walking and biking. Large parcels, industrial uses, and inadequate sidewalks on high-traffic streets further deteriorate pedestrian conditions. There are no bike lanes on any of the roads traversing I-5, despite Barrio Logans proximity to the Bayshore Bikeway. A freeway lid that reconnects the communities of Barrio Logan and Logan Heights would allow for easy non-motorized connections between the two communities that can only reasonably be achieved today via automobile. When coupled with other mobility enhancements proposed in the Barrio Logan Community Plan, freeway lids would provide safe, direct paths of travel for transit and active transportation to community amenities and additional recreation along the waterfront and within the neighborhood.","11065":"Penn Avenue Cap Connector Project: The Penn Avenue Cap Connector Project (\u201cThe Cap\u201d) will improve the crossing over the 9.1-mile Martin Luther King Jr. East Busway, a two-lane bus-only transitway that serves Pittsburgh and many of its eastern neighborhoods and suburbs, including the site of the East Liberty Transit Station, a transit-oriented mixed-use development that relied on a variety of funding sources including a $15 million TIGER grant. The Cap will widen the Penn Avenue bridge as it crosses the Martin Luther King Jr. East Busway, replacing a cramped sidewalk with a signature pedestrian environment and welcoming public realm. A new pedestrian pathway will connect Penn Avenue to Broad Street, shortening the pedestrian walk from the north side of the busway to the transit station. The sites location offers an opportunity to reimagine vibrant and safe multi-modal connections. These improvements will connect economically disadvantaged communities to the East Liberty Transit Center and to the grocery stores, parks, and services along the growing Penn Avenue corridor.","11066":"ENHANCING EASTON NEIGHBORHOOD ACCESS ON US 50 PROJECT: The Enhancing Easton Neighborhood Access on U.S. Route 50 (US 50) Project, which will dramatically improve access to daily destinations in a diverse rural community on Marylands Eastern Shore. The Project will include adding new sidewalks, pedestrian signals, and raised landscaped medians and removing challenging crossing areas that, together, will enhance the pedestrian access to grocery stores, pharmacies, and schools on the corridor, better align with planned local land use patterns, and improve safety through a historically underserved community. As one of oldest Black communities in the United States, Easton has a rich history rooted in resilience. The community has faced and overcome obstacles for decades, from the segregation and violence of the Jim Crow era to challenges accessing education, opportunities, and even essential needs (such as fresh, healthy food) and these challenges continue for the small, rural community into today. As shown by the Council on Environmental Qualitys Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool (CEJST), Easton includes a disadvantaged community through a large portion of the Project area, which is in the 91st percentile nationwide for low median income when compared with median incomes in the area. In addition, Easton residents face a high housing cost burden according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agencys (EPAs) EJScreen tool. This leaves residents with few remaining resources to purchase and maintain a reliable vehicle; therefore, the ability to access the services available locally through alternative and active transportation is critical.","11067":"DC 295\/I-295 Corridor Feasibility Study: The DC 295\/I-295 Corridor Feasibility Study aims to study ways to reconnect communities separated by transportation infrastructure in the District of Columbia Route 295 (DC 295)\/Interstate 295 (I-295) corridor (the Corridor) of the District of Columbia (the District). The Corridor contains vital roadway and rail links that separate economically disadvantaged communities. Neighborhoods west of these barriers are separated from job sites, schools, and healthcare sites; neighborhoods to the east are separated from recreational areas and the Anacostia River. The 1950s construction of DC 295\/I-295 highway resulted in a community barrier that has contributed to a legacy of inequity in many neighborhoods throughout Wards 7 and 8 within the District. This grant investment will fund Phase 2 of the holistic Corridor Feasibility Study, which will identify ways to reconnect neighborhoods in Wards 7 and 8 of the District using strategies that promote healthy, inclusive, vibrant, and equitable communities and improve the safety of residents and commuters. These strategies include analyzing existing conditions to establish a baseline; developing concepts and assessing future conditions in collaboration with residents and other key stakeholders; evaluating the benefits of these concepts based on their impact with respect to racial equity, mobility, access, sustainability, economic opportunity, and safety; and producing planning-level cost estimates and a final Feasibility Study report.","11068":"US 93 North Ninepipe Corridor Reconstruction Project: The US93 North Ninepipe Corridor Reconstruction Project will strengthen community connectivity on the Flathead Indian Reservation in western Montana through reconstruction and improvement of a 2.9-mile segment of U.S. Highway 93 (US93). The highway is the primary transportation corridor through the reservation, linking members of the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes (CSKT, Tribes) and other residents to jobs, schools, medical care, and other essential destinations. In its current condition, however, the road presents a significant barrier to community connectivity due to longstanding safety issues and a lack of adequate alternate routes. It also traverses an environmentally sensitive section of the reservation that is highly valued by the community. Reestablishing community connectivity requires innovative solutions for the traveling public that will also protect cultural and ecological resources. The project will mitigate deficiencies along 2.9 miles of US93 identified for over 20 years and reevaluated in the 2023 Ninepipe Corridor Feasibility Study. The following scope actions are based on the preferred option in the feasibility study but may be revised as needed during the design. The project will maintain the current two-lane configuration of the road. This issue has been discussed in all environmental documents for over 20 years, and lane expansion is not an option.","11069":"Blue Line - Forest Park Branch \u2013 Kedzie Avenue to Pulaski Station Track Improvements: The Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) Forest Park Branch Kedzie Avenue to Pulaski Road Track Improvements project is part of a larger program to reconstruct the Forest Park Branch of CTAs rail rapid transit system to restore service reliability and speed, provide greater environmental resilience, and enhance the overall transit experience for historically disadvantaged communities on the west side of Chicago. The project is located within the East Garfield Park and West Garfield Park communities of the City of Chicago. The communities are within an Area of Persistent Poverty and within an Historically Disadvantaged Community. The community has a lower income, higher minority population, and more transit-dependent residents than the City of Chicago overall. The track reconstruction includes numerous components, including the removal of the existing, outdated track structure and the installation of new track and signaling. The result of this work will be a fully modernized track system that can meet the challenges of the new railcar fleet and offers increased safety and reliability for revenue operations and maintenance.","11070":"An Evaluation of East-West Connectivity in Central Hamilton County: The Evaluation of East-West Connectivity in Central Hamilton County will analyze transportation facilities. Interstate 75 and the Norfolk Southern, CSX Transportation, and Genesee & Wyoming rail lines. Located north of the City of Cincinnati, six jurisdictions comprising the Cities of Reading and Sharonville and the Villages of Arlington Heights, Evendale, Lincoln Heights, and Lockland have experienced firsthand the negative consequences created by their proximity to these four transportation facilities. These facilities have hindered mobility and restricted connectivity for residents and businesses located nearby and represent a significant obstacle to future success in the area. Interstate 75s presence in Hamilton County has been defined by its status as one of the busiest freeways in the United States, with average annual daily traffic exceeding 120,000 cars in central Hamilton County. In addition to the interstate, the presence of freight rail lines, owned and operated by Norfolk Southern Railway, CSX Transportation, and Genesee & Wyoming, are a significant barrier to mobility, directly impacting residents and businesses. Frequent stoppages of freight service along these transportation corridors have halted traffic along local streets that connect communities. The stoppages created by rail lines, most notably Norfolk Southerns Dayton District railroad line, are routinely extensive; residents and local businesses recall waiting as long as twelve hours at times for stopped trains to resume service. Beyond impacting general mobility in the region, stopped trains also present operational challenges for local emergency services in the focus area. While emergency responders have identified alternative routes to avoid potential stoppages along these lines, the added response time has material impact on members of the public who rely on local services in moments of dire need.","11071":"Bienville Boulevard\/Scott Pruitt Memorial Highway Multi-Use Path\u2013 Connecting Ocean Springs and Gautier, Mississippi: The Mississippi Department of Transportation (MDOT) is seeking funding for the construction of an 8.75- mile Multi-Use Path on the north side of US 90 from Ocean Springs to Gautier in Jackson County, MS. MDOT has committed $2.4 million in state program funds as the match for the federal grant. For more than a decade, the MDOT has been working with the Gulf Coast communities of Ocean Springs and Gautier to address safety and access problems with Bienville Boulevard\/Scott Pruitt Memorial Highway (US 90) from Washington Avenue (MS Highway 609) in Ocean Springs to Dolphin Drive in Gautier. The Multi-Use Path will be constructed in conjunction with a roadway improvement project for US 90. The MDOT is currently in the process of adding the US 90 improvement project and the adjoining Multi-Use Path to the Gulf Regional Planning Commission (GRPC) Transportation Improvement Plan. The Multi-Use Path provides safe new connectivity both within Ocean Springs and Gautier proper, as well as to each other. The corridor has very limited pedestrian or bicycle facilities today. The high traffic volumes and operating speeds on US 90 make the roadway an unsafe location for bicyclists. Average daily traffic volumes vary between over 50,000 vehicles on the western end to just under 30,000 vehicles on the eastern end. Between 2018 and 2022 there were 15 accidents involving pedestrians or bicyclists. US 90 is the key non-interstate east-west corridor along the Gulf Coast, spanning from Florida to Texas. The highways route through Mississippi mostly hugs the coastline, making the facility subject to tropical storms and hurricanes. US 90, within the project area also serves as Jackson Countys east-west hurricane evacuation route for the coastal area, connecting evacuees to the northbound evacuation routes of MS Highway 609, MS Highway 57, and MS Highway 63.","11072":"Virginia Beach Trail Phase 1: A Regional Connector: This project will construct 3.2-miles of the Virginia Beach Trail, which includes the construction of a 10-foot-wide paved shared-use path within the former Norfolk Southern railroad right-of_x0002_way. There is an existing transit station at the western end and an economic center, the Town Center of Virginia Beach, on the eastern end. The Virginia Beach Trail will promote equitable access to an active transportation network, increase pedestrian and bicycle user safety, and reconnect underserved communities with economic opportunities that have been limited by physical transportation barriers. The project will include a pedestrian bridge over Independence Boulevard to address both connectivity and pedestrian safety. The City is proposing that the westernmost 3.2-mile section of the Virginia Beach Trail be prioritized for construction through this capital construction grant program. This segment\u2014 termed Phase I\u2014extends from Newtown Road (the city limit between Virginia Beach and neighboring City of Norfolk) to Constitution Drive in the Virginia Beach Town Center, which is located in the Central Business District of the City. Future phases of the Virginia Beach Trail extend to the easternmost part of the city with connectivity to the oceanfront. The citys wide state highways, numerous interstates, and urban sprawl across more than 300 square miles has established an environment conducive to vehicles, but now requires strategic planning and new construction projects to safely accommodate other, active modes of transportation into the network and provide equitable access to destinations across the city. Virginia Beach Trail will offer a multimodal transportation option to reconnect established communities to jobs, commerce, and recreational opportunities, as well as connect to existing shared use paths for better access to the active transportation network across Virginia Beach.","11073":"Bailey Avenue Corridor Improvements - Bus Rapid Transit Construction and Context-Sensitive Roadway Retrofit: The Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority (\u201cNFTA\u201d) requests funds to complete environmental reviews, design, and construction of Bailey Avenue Corridor Improvements. The Project will design and construct a low or no emission Bus Rapid Transit line and context_x0002_sensitive roadway safety improvements along the entire length of Bailey Avenue in the City of Buffalo, New York, from the terminus of the NFTA-Metro Rail system at the University at Buffalo South Campus to South Park Avenue. Bailey Avenue is one of the city and regions key north-south commercial corridors.

The Citys East Side, home to 42% or approximately 100,000 of the Citys residents, has significant historic resources, community_x0002_based assets, walkable thoroughfares, education and training resources, and access to public transit. People of color make up 78% of the Citys East Sides population. According to the 2015- 19 American Community Survey, the Bailey Avenue corridor is home to nearly half of the East Sides residents, 54% of whom identify as Black. The corridor is one of the most densely populated, low-income, zero-or one-car household areas in the region.","11074":"Reconnecting Lemon Creek: Improving Nonmotorized Access and Community Equity with the Lemon Creek Multimodal Pathway: The City and Borough of Juneaus project seeks to mitigate the existing roadway barriers to safe pedestrian and non-motorized access for residents of Lemon Creek created by the Egan Drive arterial and heavy industrial traffic on Glacier Highway. Specifically, RCN Community Planning funds would support the planning, design, and community engagement needed for the installation of a critical non-motorized pathway to provide safe, convenient, community-centric nonmotorized access within, as well as to and from, the underserved community of Lemon Creek and a) key daily destinations, including the communitys schools, medical, employment and commerce centers, and b) the adjacent Mendenhall Wetlands and trails, which provide vital natural, recreational, subsistence, health, and quality of life benefits. Egan Drive and Glacier Highway are barriers for residents of Lemon Creek. There is currently no pedestrian infrastructure on Egan Drive, and heavy industrial traffic along Glacier Highway makes existing bike lanes and sidewalks dangerous and unpleasant. A multimodal path will help residents of Lemon Creek access daily destinations in other areas of Juneau such as schools, jobs, and stores, as well as the Mendenhall Wetlands.","11075":"Twinbrook Pedestrian and Bicycle Bridge: This project will design a pedestrian and bicycle crossing over railroad tracks to reconnect the Twinbrook Community to the employment areas and retail amenities along Rockville Pike, the Citys largest commercial corridor. In 1984, the existing at-grade crossing was eliminated with the construction of the Twinbrook Metrorail Station, further separating the community, which includes disadvantaged census tracts. This project will identify a preferred alternative, prepare a cost benefit analysis, enhance ongoing public engagement, develop a 30 percent engineering design, and create strategies to prevent displacement and advance community stewardship. Rockville residents and community leaders have long been aware of disparities in terms of development patterns and access to opportunities found on either side of the tracks and hope this project will help mitigate these issues. Providing a pedestrian and bicycle crossing of the railroad tracks in Twinbrook has been included in several approved City plans, including the adopted Rockville 2040 Comprehensive Plan, and the proposed Pedestrian Master Plan.","11076":"Borough of Naugatuck Eastside-Westside Connectivity and Rail Mitigation Planning Project: The project will provide planning funding to enable ultimate construction of a pedestrian connection, linking together the Borough of Naugatucks Metro North Rail Line and downtown core in the west with the Naugatuck River Greenway Trail and State Route Highway 8 in the east. The east and west sides are currently disconnected by the Metro North Rail Line and the Naugatuck River, with affordable and market rate housing developments taking shape on either side of the river. The proposed project will provide planning funds for a pedestrian connection that ties together the adaptive reuse of over 20 acres of brownfields in the BONs downtown core, including the construction of transit-oriented, mixed-rate\/affordable housing. The proposed concept brief for such a connection includes a concrete underpass 60 feet in length that tunnels beneath the Metro North Railroad Line, with an 183-foot pre-fabricated pedestrian bridge spanning the length of the Naugatuck River. Such a pedestrian connection would address current transportation deficiencies as a result of the rail line, while establishing an active transportation link between the two neighborhoods. Residents are currently disconnected from each other and their river as a result of the rail line facility. Ease of access and public health and safety remain areas of concern as a result of the existing facility. Planning funds would be utilized for public engagement, conceptual and preliminary design activities, planning studies & activities, and design and planning in support of the environmental review process. Additionally, funds will link together, and finalize, the Boroughs transit-oriented downtown redevelopment that has over $425M in private, municipal, State, or Federal funding.","11077":"Reconnecting North Long Beach - Hamilton Loop Project: The Hamilton Loop Project (Project) will reconnect a community that has long been divided by State Route 91 (SR-91). The Project is a community-driven concept that will transform the SR-91 embankment, underpasses, and nearby streets into a thriving community park space along a two-mile loop that connects both sides of the freeway. The Hamilton Loop will likely include a pedestrian path, protected bike lane, community gardens, carbon-sequestering landscaping, play and fitness equipment, a dog park, picnic areas, and more. SR-91 bisects North Long Beach, a community that is home to roughly 30,000 residents who are primarily low-income and people of color. The freeway has served as a physical barrier for decades, making it difficult for residents to walk and bike from their home on one side of the freeway, to the schools, shops, and other resources on the opposite side of the freeway. While there are five underpasses that connect the north and south sides of the community, residents are hesitant about traveling by foot due to fast moving vehicles, lack of shade, and other safety concerns. There is also limited park space in the community, which includes only .9 acres of parkland per 1,000 residents compared to 5.6 acres of parkland per 1,000 residents citywide. The Hamilton Loop Project will bring resources to a bifurcated community by adding green space in a park-poor neighborhood while providing active transportation options and improving air quality through carbon capturing landscaping.","11078":"The Southeast Community Greenway Reconnector: The Southeast Community Greenway Reconnector Project is the latest effort to address past injustices in Newport News and the Southeast Community by providing a strong multimodal connection point over I-664 and the CSX Railroad. The city envisions the existing 28th Street bridge as a Complete Streets facility that can also serve as a public green space, attraction for public respite, and community asset. By making the bridge itself a destination, urban park and green space, the lengthy connection from the neighborhoods southeast of the interstate and the downtown area could become a pleasant multi-modal experience for use by pedestrians, bicyclists, transit modes and cars. The Reconnector would be the latest major contributor to the ongoing renaissance of Newport News; creating a thriving, inclusive, resilient community that would help connect the many separate development efforts in the Downtown District and Southeast Community. Full access would help bridge the gap between the inequities of the two communities, create access to resources previously cut off, and bring economic development and job opportunities to all for shared prosperity. The Southeast Community and Greenway Reconnector Project would overcome the barrier and lessen the burden created by I-664 and the CSX Railroad by providing a strong attractive connection for multiple modes of transportation, inclusive and open to all groups for safe access and freedom of movement.","11079":"Riverfront Infrastructure Vitality and Equity Restoration in East Toledo (RIVER East Toledo): The Riverfront Infrastructure Vitality and Equity Restoration in East Toledo (RIVER East Toledo) project will reconnect residents of Toledo, Ohios historic east side with the opportunities, amenities, and natural spaces of Toledos downtown riverfront. Shaped by heavy industry and proximity to Lake Erie shipping corridors, East Toledo was once a thriving working-class immigrant community. Today, deindustrialization and disinvestment \u2013 fueled by suburbanization and interstate highway construction \u2013 have made East Toledo one of the citys most disadvantaged communities, with high poverty rates, heavy environmental burdens, and disproportionate barriers to safe transportation access. The application proposes the following improvements: a new multi-use path connection; Intersection realignment and narrowing, ADA signal upgrades, brick crosswalks, and new multi_x0002_use path connection; Implementation of a road diet, traffic calming, widened pedestrian zone, streetscaping, and street trees; Intersection realignment, brick crosswalks, ADA signal upgrade, and eliminated turn restrictions; Roadway resurfacing, ADA signal upgrades, high-visibility crosswalks, streetscaping, and street trees; Roundabout with pedestrian refuge islands; Resurfacing, medians with planters and pedestrian refuge islands, high-visibility crosswalks, streetscaping, and street trees; High-visibility crosswalks; medians with pedestrian refuge islands; reconfigure park entrance to exit-only; New ADA signal, high-visibility crosswalks, and widened sidewalk approach; and a Midblock crossing with pedestrian hybrid beacon.","11080":"(re)Connect West Laramie - Wyoming: Union Pacific railroad tracks, which run through the near center of the community, are Laramies largest transportation barrier, dividing the eastern and western portions of the community. Laramies historic West Side neighborhood is sandwiched between the railroad tracks, the Laramie River, and I-80. A 197-acre historic site, Wyoming Territorial Prison, sits between the West Side and I-80, making the West Side and West Laramie neighborhoods detached from the greater community. They are also separated from one another by the Laramie River and Highway 130\/Snowy Range Road, dividing the city into three or more separate neighborhood communities. Existing infrastructure bifurcates the east and west neighborhoods within the city. As a result, the west side suffers higher rates of socioeconomic and environmental disparity and more limited access to key social services and amenities. This project will study alternatives to an existing footbridge, including a multiuse elevated pedestrian path and other opportunities to improve existing non-motorized pathways. The applicant has achieved several local partnerships with municipal offices, DOT, local grassroots and business coalitions. This grant proposal will develop solutions to connect all city neighborhoods with the West Side and West Laramie, providing greater access to daily destinations like schools, cultural institutions, and employment.","11081":"MLK Community Reconnection Project: The Norwalk Redevelopment Agency (the Agency), in partnership with the City of Norwalk (the City), is actively advancing efforts to reconnect our community and alleviate the division I-95 has imposed for over six decades. The MLK Community Reconnection Project will provide strategic roadway improvements and creative solutions involving public art, lighting, and landscaping to alleviate traffic concerns. Norwalk, Connecticut was divided by the construction of I-95. The construction of I-95 tore through Norwalk, CT, dividing the working-class city and contributing to the citys economic decline through the physical separation it resurrected, it additionally facilitated the loss of middle-class residents, businesses, and industry from South Norwalk to surrounding suburban town causing the decline manufacturing economy in the mid-20th century. The MLK Community Corridor has been in a fight ever since for its revitalization. Even with great strides in the 21st century, the corridor remains disenfranchised and inundated with safety and environmental risks posed by I-95, the car centric corridor that it created, and the lack of viable alternative transit between the business districts on either end. The study area includes the junction of I-95 and a second freeway (US 7). Norwalk Redevelopment Agency proposes a planning study to make multimodal improvements to three facilities that cross I-95, an arterial (MLK Drive, West Ave) along an approximate 2-mile corridor, a minor street (Crescent Street) and a shared use path (Norwalk River Valley Trail). The southern edge of the study area has a commuter rail station (South Norwalk) while the northern end has a bus transit hub. This project also aims to establish safe and reliable pedestrian, bicycle, and public transit routes while camouflaging the I-95 and RT7 overpass junction to reestablish a seamless connection between the MLK community, South Norwalk, Wall Street, and the larger city.","11082":"2023 NAE Planning Grant - Phenix City - Crawford Road\/13th Street Corridor Planning Project: The City of Phenix City will conduct a planning study to explore removing, retrofitting, or mitigating the Crawford Road\/13th Street Corridor. The Crawford Road\/13th Street was once part of U.S. Highway 280 which bisected the city and cut off connectivity. U.S. Highway 280 has since been realigned but it is still constructed like a highway; with six lanes and wide, open landscape giving drivers little incentive to abide by the posted speed limit of 30 mph. For those relying on bicycle or foot travel, Crawford Road\/13th Street is an asphalt barrier preventing safe travel. The current cross section of Crawford Road lacks pedestrian access along most of the corridor. To eliminate the barrier created by the current construction of Crawford Road\/13th Street, Phenix City will seek a professional engineering\/planning firm to develop a plan that includes an analysis of the existing conditions and analysis of future conditions (including three build alternatives). The plan will also involve community outreach, as well as specific engagement with residents of the public housing properties along the corridor.

Improvements from the project will provide access for multiple modes, including low carbon modes, and for people with disabilities.","11085":"Removing the Scars of Urban Renewal: This planning project is a strategic and collaborative initiative to address infrastructure barriers created by 1960s and 70s-era \u201cUrban Renewal\u201d efforts. Between 1966 and 1980, the Haverhill Housing Authority (HHA) engaged in several phases of Urban Renewal projects which removed properties and buildings out of private hands and into the hands of the HHA. Over time, the formerly prosperous hub of small businesses in downtown Haverhill became blocks of open land known as the \u201cdust bowl.\u201d Ginty Boulevard and Bailey Boulevard were created as eight blocks of parkway to connect the city center with the newly created suburban highway US 495. Though connectivity was the goal, these developments instead resulted in infrastructure barriers that separated neighborhoods and residents. This separation reduced access to commercial centers, workforce opportunities, health and emergency services, education, and other neighborhoods within the city, drastically stunting the communitys potential for growth and diminishing quality of life for its citizens. This project will formally launch the planning process to remove these barriers and increase mobility and access for historically disadvantaged neighborhoods. The project will also create new opportunities for developing affordable and workforce housing while fostering transit_x0002_oriented development.","11086":"Connecting North to South: A Complete 6th Street: Connecting North to South: A Complete 6th Street reconnects several of Milwaukees historic and diverse communities that have suffered decades of negative impacts from highway construction. The Project transforms 2.6 miles (North Avenue to National Avenue) of 6th Street, an important corridor connecting predominantly Black communities on the northside through the Downtown economic core south to the regional intermodal station and the gateway of Milwaukees Hispanic communities on the southside. The construction of I-94\/I-43 in the 1960s not only tore through the heart of many of Milwaukees diverse communities, but also spurred the expansion of adjacent streets to accommodate access ramps and their associated traffic. Six of the eight census tracts represented in the project are highly disadvantaged. A transformed 6th Street will include safe, dedicated infrastructure for walking, biking, and transit as well as green infrastructure that will provide much needed tree canopy and green space while easing the load on the Citys combined sewer system. Informed by extensive engagement, the projects design aims to connect disadvantaged communities to opportunity through a people-centered corridor that offers cost-effective and climate-friendly mobility options and improves quality of life.","11087":"Reconnecting 4th Ave N: A Two-Way Vision for Reviving Legacy and Inspiring Progress: The 4th Ave N project is a 15-block Complete Streets redesign of Birminghams Black Main Street.

This application would provide access to a minimum of 0.76 miles of upstream spawning and rearing habitat for wild Coho salmon and wild steelhead among other aquatic organisms.","11361":"Birmingham Transportation Capital Investment Plan: Funds will be used to advance data-driven transportation recommendations in the nine Imagine Birmingham plans and other relevant assessments to mitigate the negative impact of interstates, railroads, and major arterial roadways. The Transportation Capital Investment Plan will identify implementation projects that leverage existing corridors to reconnect Birmingham\u2019s historic neighborhoods, thriving urban villages, and commercial areas. When a controversial racial zoning law was struck down in 1950, Birmingham planners used the ensuing construction of interstates to advance a segregationist agenda. This was done by purposefully building the new highways along a route that mirrored the old racial zoning boundaries. The new highway network resulted in a clear physical and psychological delineation between black and white communities \u2013 one that continues to this day. The city used census data and other available tools to evaluate the existing issues in the community and the need for the planning study. The need for the project is supported by data about a compelling description of how the existing rail and highway infrastructure present barriers to access and mobility. The city will develop a representative community advisory group to lead the planning study, and to recruit paid community ambassadors.","11362":"Meskwaki Reconnecting Communities: Funds will be used towards planning improvements of the existing four-lane divided Highway 30, which is a barrier impacting multimodal access to daily destinations. The result of the activities would be project readiness documentation to support a future capital construction grant application. The Sac & Fox Tribe of Mississippi in Iowa (with the self-identified name as Meskwaki) governs themselves from their tribal headquarters located on the Meskwaki Settlement in eastcentral Iowa. US Highway 30, a high-speed, four-lane expressway, travels directly through the small community. It creates a barrier for most of the residents who live on the east side but work on the west at the community\u2019s major employer. This causes significant safety and hazardous road conditions for those in the community, supported by crash and serious injury data.","11363":"Shoshone-Paiute Tribes Reconnecting Communities Planning Grant: Funds will be used to study the development of a trail system on the Duck Valley Indian Reservation to connect and access critical services, activities, and sites. The Tribes plan to create a \"Community Advisory Group\" to work with a Project Coordinator and participate in the community-based planning effort, provide feedback, and guide the process. The Shoshone-Paiute Tribes (Tribes) of the Duck Valley Indian Reservation are located on the Idaho-Nevada border. The Reservation is only accessible by Highway 51\/225, a two-lane northsouth thoroughfare that houses a daycare, gas station, local stores, housing neighborhoods, the school, recreation center, and health clinic serving the community. To the Tribes, the highway is considered both an avenue and a barrier as facilities exist on both sides, but there are few marked pedestrian crossings and none with flashers or lights except for those near the school. The project will be the first study of its kind for this community. Additionally, the Tribes have a transportation master plan and an economic development plan. The project also includes a wellthought-out plan for community engagement.","11364":"Frankfort Reconnecting Communities Pilot Project: Funds will be used to support design and engineering for pedestrian safety improvements along the 0.8-mile auto-centric Versailles Road corridor (U.S. Route 60\/421) between East Main Street and Brighton Park Boulevard. The funding will help Frankfort safely connect low-income and minority residents with economic opportunities and key community assets across a busy local road. Once called Green Hill, the project area was one of the earliest Black settlements in Frankfort, settled in the early 19th century. The area was first developed with Black schools, churches, restaurants, and businesses. In the 1910s, Franklin County and the Commonwealth of Kentucky focused its transportation improvements on building new highways and upgrading older turnpikes. U.S. Route 60 was constructed during this time period to connect Frankfort with Lexington, pushing through the Green Hill community without regard to the equity or access concerns of local residents. The project includes a plan for holistic community engagement, including such inclusive measures as childcare during meetings and walking tours. Additionally, the project includes strategies, such as Federal Section 8 housing subsidies and energy assistance, inclusive economic development, and creative strategies like removing or sealing off points of contamination within a property in order for the property to be used again without health concerns.","11365":"Bridging I-696: Connecting Oak Park: The project will reconstruct a deck\/plaza over Interstate 696 in suburban Detroit at a point which bisects the Orthodox Jewish community of Oak Park into two halves. Currently, I-696 is trenched in Oak Park and has three large bridge decks to reconnect the community, one of which is failing and will be obsolete by 2025. Michigan DOT proposes to remove and replace the deck in order to maintain the connection for the community, as well as maintain an important pedestrian and bicycle connection. The existing deck leaks water, causing icicles to form, creating safety issues for drivers on the interstate in the winter. The applicant noted the freeway cap is a vital connector to local businesses, schools, places of worship, and other daily destinations for the Orthodox Jewish community in the project area. The project is located in and serves historically disadvantaged communities. Much of the public engagement has been coordinated with faith-based leaders and has a project-specific public involvement plan including outreach specific to the community\u2019s preferences. To minimize the construction-related impacts, MDOT will construct temporary walkways and make other accommodations for pedestrians.","11366":"Reconnect South Park: Funds will be used to support a planning study, including technical studies and community visioning for removing or restructuring SR-99 where it cuts through the South Park neighborhood of Seattle, interrupting local roads and connectivity. This planning study intends to examine the redesign and removal of the SR-99 roadway to accommodate local travel and improve accessibility better and more safely. It will consider nature-based resilience strategies to address heat and flooding issues. The plan builds on previous work with in-depth technical studies and community visioning. A neighborhood-based coalition, comprising more than 12 community organizations selected by community members, will lead the community engagement process to develop the Community Vision Plan. An advisory team, including representatives from the neighborhoods, is also being formed and the project has the funding support of the City of Seattle and Washington State DOT. South Park has historically been home to immigrants arriving in Seattle, and these communities were likely the reason why SR-99 was planned to cut through (rather than serve) the neighborhood itself. A dark, narrow underpass is the only at-grade crossing through the entire 1.5-mile stretch of highway dividing the neighborhood. This barrier severely limits access to jobs, healthcare and opportunity and has created one of the most disadvantaged neighborhoods in the region. 74% of Black Indigenous and residents of color are in the 99th percentile for negative health outcomes and socioeconomic disadvantage.","11367":"The City of Kalamazoo: Reconnecting Communities Pilot Project for Kalamazoo and Michigan Avenues: The project will upgrade Kalamazoo and Michigan Avenues with traffic calming measures and pedestrian, bicycle, and transit improvements. Michigan DOT designated these roads as one-way roads approximately 60 years ago, creating a high-speed and high-volume traffic corridor through downtown, dividing the community and creating access barriers for neighborhoods. Michigan Avenue will shift from a four- to five-lane one-way street with parking on both sides to a two-way street with single lanes, dedicated left turn lanes, on-street parking, and bike lanes, as well as pedestrian infrastructure. Kalamazoo Avenue will shift from a three-lane one-way street to a two-way road with two-lanes in each direction and a center turn lane with pedestrian infrastructure and bus stops. The project will serve as a \u201ccornerstone project\u201d for the city's downtown, improving safety, mobility, and community connectivity. About 60-years ago, the Michigan Department of Transportation imposed a one-way street system on the east-west street corridor in the Central Business District of the City of Kalamazoo, Michigan. The downstream consequences of the high-speed, one-way road designations 60 years ago were not fully considered. The project alignment followed historic redlining practices and resulted in a physical barrier between the City\u2019s Northside, predominantly Black neighborhood and the central business district core with its business and commercial development. This severely limited access and opportunity for those cut off. The city has already conducted significant community outreach, including creating the Complete Street Advisory Committee that involves residents from interest groups and core neighborhoods, and will continue to do so throughout the completion of the project. The existing roadway design is automobile-focused with the primary goal of facilitating commuters from outside the neighborhood at the expense of residents. The redesigned road configuration will reconnect the disadvantaged neighborhood north of the dividing road with the downtown areas to the south using \u201cWalkable City Rules\u201d and Complete Streets principles. There is also support from the city\u2019s transit agency to incorporate transit and bike friendly elements in the network redesign. Some efforts will be made to address climate resilience and the redesign may allow freight to move more efficiently. Partners include entities with geographic ties to communities adjacent to Kalamazoo, as well as community-based organizations, anchor institutions (hospitals, universities), local businesses, governmental partners, and more.","11368":"Vision 980 Study Phase 2 - Feasibility Study: Funds will be used to explore alternatives for reconnecting communities along the I-980 corridor with an expanded focus on community integration and environmental justice. The I-980 freeway divides disadvantaged communities in West Oakland from downtown Oakland and is a barrier to travel and economic opportunities between these communities. When construction on I-980 began in the 1960s, it was intended as an eastern approach to the San Francisco Bay Southern Crossing \u2013 a second Bay Bridge that was never constructed. Construction of the project resulted in the loss of 503 homes, 22 businesses, and four churches \u2013 almost all of which belonged to disadvantaged communities. The result was a freeway that created barriers to active transportation and limited access to employment, services and opportunities in Downtown Oakland for residents of the adjacent West Oakland community. The application details existing needs and historic disparities and provides results of an equity analysis. The impacted communities are economically disadvantaged and experience poor air quality. The project will utilize strong existing partnerships and employ innovative means of community engagement. The plan aims to improve accommodation of non-motorized modes, access to transit, and explore options for lessening the barrier, ranging from freeway removal to improvements to the crossings of the existing facility. The plan will build on existing work, including the activities of Connect Oakland and other planning studies. The application discusses Oakland\u2019s existing anti-displacement strategies and discusses place-making and inclusive economic development.","11369":"West Baltimore United: Funds will be used to study the possibility of removing, retrofitting, or modifying the impacts caused by the construction of US 40\/Franklin-Mulberry Expressway. The project seeks to reconnect historically Black communities that were divided due to the construction of this highway in 1975, thereby addressing inequities and improving safety, access, opportunity, and innovation in West Baltimore. The construction of US 40\/Franklin-Mulberry Expressway removed 14 contiguous blocks of a predominantly middle-class Black community and caused the demolition of 971 homes and 62 businesses. This resulted in the displacement of more than 1,500 people. Today, the short section of expressway is commonly known as \u201cThe Highway to Nowhere\u201d and the communities of West Baltimore have struggled to recover ever since. Partnerships and support for this project include transit providers, environmental agencies, local elected officials, and non-profit representation. The application has clear evidence of a community-driven vision for this planning process, with focus on community stabilization policies related to both affordable housing, community benefits agreements, disadvantaged\/minority\/woman owned business enterprise goals for projects, and more.","11370":"Little Rock I-30 Deck Park Phase I Planning Study: Funds will be used to study the feasibility of a project that would reconnect neighborhoods divided by I-30 with a deck park between 6th and 9th Streets. The planning grant funds will be used to conduct community engagement (including a Community Participation Plan and Community Advisory Board), investigate the practical and economic feasibility of a deck park spanning I-30, and develop the conceptual design of a deck park. The City of Little Rock identified I-30 as the transportation facility that has had a significant negative impact on the MacArthur Park and Hanger Hill neighborhoods. Once flourishing, both suffered from the impact of \u201cUrban Renewal\u201d in 1961, when I-30 paved through their community\u2019s houses, businesses, churches, and green space. This resulted in a fractured community that became burdened by increasingly negative economic, educational, and social opportunities \u2013 many of which continue to this day. Decennial 2020 census data shows that the eastern half of the study area has higher poverty and disability rates, and lower education rates than comparable localities in the state. The project demonstrates a strong intention to address the equitable impacts and includes considerable community engagement. This project has support from the Arkansas DOT, the Neighborhood Coalition, and community and neighborhood participants.","11371":"Big Creek Greenway Community Connectivity Planning Project: Funds will be used to design a multi-use path connecting economically disadvantaged residents to jobs, health care, education, and other civic life. Georgia DOT owns the right-of-way underneath GA 400 and is providing a 20-foot easement to the City of Roswell to build a multiuse path. The project will unite the Liberty Square Neighborhood (a Historically Disadvantaged Community and Area of Persistent Poverty), Roswell\u2019s town center, the City of Alpharetta, and the greater Metro Atlanta through the Big Creek Greenway. The State of Georgia began constructing GA 400 in 1954 and culminated in the completion of eight lanes in 1989. The highway cut off the Liberty Square Neighborhood from the greater Roswell community. Since that time, residents of Roswell have been unable to cross the highway. Roswell residents consider this connection critical and rated it as a high priority. The multi-use path would be a recreational facility that also provides Liberty Square residents access to a recreational park. The project results from information material translated into Spanish; English\/Spanish public meetings, surveys, and focus group interviews; childcare at public meetings; virtual meeting options; and pop-up community events.","11372":"The Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority to upgrade its Cold Spring Bus Maintenance Facility with the infrastructure needed to charge zeroemissio_NY: The Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority will receive funds to upgrade its Cold Spring Bus Maintenance Facility with the infrastructure needed to charge zero-emission battery-powered electric buses as they begin to be introduced into the Metro Bus fleet.","11373":"The Delaware Transit Corporation to purchase of battery electric buses with supporting equipment and infrastructure to replace diesel buses that have _DE: The Delaware Transit Corporation will receive funds to purchase of battery electric buses with supporting equipment and infrastructure to replace diesel buses that have exceeded their useful life.","11374":"The Denver Regional Transit District for electric vehicles charging stations and infrastructure upgrades_CO: The Denver Regional Transit District will receive funds for electric vehicles, charging stations, and infrastructure upgrades.","11375":"The Central Ohio Transit Authority to purchase electric vehicles and infrastructure to replace buses at the end of their useful life_OH: The Central Ohio Transit Authority will receive funds to purchase electric vehicles and infrastructure to replace buses at the end of their useful life.","11376":"GoRaleigh to purchase electric buses and chargers_NC: GoRaleigh will receive funds to purchase electric buses and chargers.","11377":"Capital Metro for battery electric buses to expand their electric bus fleet and evaluate the performance and interoperability of various technology pr_TX: Capital Metro will receive funds for battery electric buses to expand their electric bus fleet and evaluate the performance and interoperability of various technology providers and platforms.","11378":"SunTran to purchase buses and chargers on the St George to Springdale route including overnight chargers and onroute chargers at each terminus_UT: SunTran will receive funds to purchase buses and chargers on the St George to Springdale route, including overnight chargers and on-route chargers at each terminus.","11379":"Lextran toward the design and construction of a covered storage area and the incremental cost of additional zero emission vehicles_KY: Lextran will receive funds toward the design and construction of a covered storage area and the incremental cost of additional zero emission vehicles.","11380":"King County Metro to purchase electric vehicles to replaces buses at the end of their useful life_WA: King County Metro will receive funds to purchase electric vehicles to replaces buses at the end of their useful life.","11381":"The Charlotte Area Transit System CATS to purchase electric buses with dedicated charging stations and provide maintenance and first responder trainin_NC: The Charlotte Area Transit System (CATS) will receive funds to purchase electric buses with dedicated charging stations and provide maintenance and first responder training for the new technology.","11382":"The New Orleans Regional Transit Authority to purchase battery electric buses and charging equipment part of its ongoing fleet electrification project_LA: The New Orleans Regional Transit Authority will receive funds to purchase battery electric buses and charging equipment, part of its ongoing fleet electrification project.
