The purpose of the ATP is to make annual grants available to eligible airports for airport terminal and airport-owned Airport Traffic Control Towers development projects that address the aging infrastructure of our nation&#;s airports. In addition, ATP grants will align with DOT&#;s Strategic Framework FY- at https://www.transportation.gov/administrations/office-policy/fy--strategic-framework. The FY  ATP will be implemented consistent with law and in alignment with the priorities in Executive Order , Implementation of the Infrastructure Investments and Jobs Act ( FR ), which are to invest efficiently and equitably; promote the competitiveness of the U.S. economy; improve job opportunities by focusing on high labor standards; strengthen infrastructure resilience to all hazards including climate change; and to effectively coordinate with State, local, Tribal, and territorial government partners.

The funding available for this year&#;s grants totals approximately $ million.The Department recognizes the role that infrastructure investment plays in economic development and job creation, and the added urgency of this funding at time when the COVID- pandemic has put stress on state and local budgets.For the first time, the USDOT seeks INFRA projects that address climate change and environmental justice. Projects will be evaluated on whether they were planned as part of a comprehensive strategy to address climate change, or whether they support strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions such as deploying zero-emission-vehicle infrastructure or encouraging modal shift and a reduction in vehicle-miles-traveled. Racial equity will also be considered as a selection criterion, to the extent that project sponsors have completed equity-focused community outreach, and projects are designed to benefit underserved communities. The Department will also consider whether the project is located in a federally designated community development zone, including qualified Opportunity Zones, Empowerment Zones, Promise Zones, or Choice Neighborhoods.USDOT seeks projects that apply innovative technology, delivery, or financing methods with proven outcomes to deliver projects in a cost effective manner. The Department will make awards under the INFRA program to both large and small projects. For a large project, the INFRA grant must be at least $ million. For a small project, the grant must be at least $ million. Under statutory requirements,  percent of available funds are reserved for small projects, and the Department must award at least  percent of funding for rural projects. INFRA grants may be used to fund a variety of components of an infrastructure project, however, the Department is specifically focused on projects in which the local sponsor is significantly invested and is positioned to proceed rapidly to construction. Eligible INFRA project costs may include: reconstruction, rehabilitation, acquisition of property (including land related to the project and improvements to the land), environmental mitigation, construction contingencies, equipment acquisition, and operational improvements directly related to system performance. The INFRA NOFO also announces the creation of the &#;INFRA Extra&#; Program, which will identify competitive INFRA applicants who do not receive an INFRA award and authorize them to seek a Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act of  (TIFIA) loan up to  percent of their project cost.
